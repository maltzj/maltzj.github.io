title: Multiplying Your Impact Through Mentoring at Droicon UK
---

<p>I recently presented a new and improved version of my talk on "Multiplying
Your Impact Through Mentoring" presentation, this time at Droidcon London.  A
friend at Yelp suggests that the third time is the best time for any
presentation, and after the fourth presentation it's time to retire the talk.  I
definitely felt like that was true this time, so I just need to find one last
time to present this talk and ride off into the sunset.</p>

<p>The video recording is also really well done, and you can watch that at<a

    official Droidcon UK website</a></p>
