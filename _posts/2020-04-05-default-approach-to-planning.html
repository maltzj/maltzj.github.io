title: A Default Approach to Quarterly Planning 
---

<p>Teams often find themselves in a position where they need to figure out how
much work they can commit to, most commonly in quarterly planning.  If you've
never done this before then wading through a world of possibilities to get to a
commitment can feel impossible.  Fortunately, I've found that a default approach
can help you establish a plan reasonably quickly and with minimal overhead.</p>

<p>Before going further, I've created this <a
    href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A_kiYX1x4mUVD4kiCEuw22xe2YcyhVFJ4M2hjnUdmo8/edit#gid=0">this
    spreadsheet.</a> as an example of this process for a theoretical food
delivery company.  We'll be revisiting the spreadsheet a couple of times, so
take a quick skim of the first row of each sheet.</p>

<p>Skimming successful? Great. Let's move into the details.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Figure out your goals</h2>

<p>Before you go figuring out what to build this quarter, you need to figure out what you're trying to
achieve.  In Silicon Valley, this frequently looks like <a
                                                            href="https://upraise.io/blog/writing-effective-okrs/">defining
                                                            OKRs</a>, but any
goal setting framework will do.  What's important is that you have some common
yardstick to measure each project's impact and prevent the loudest opinion from
dictating what the team will work on.</p>

<p>After you've defined your OKRs, write them down so they can be referenced
later in planning.  This should give you something like <a
    href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A_kiYX1x4mUVD4kiCEuw22xe2YcyhVFJ4M2hjnUdmo8/edit#gid=0">the
    first sheet of our example.</a></p>

<h2>Step 2: Make a list of projects and their impact</h2>

<p>Once you have your goals, the next step is to write down possible
projects and their impact. In the interest of keeping this list manageable, a
"project" is something that will take more than 1 staff-week of work. Many of these
will be user-facing features, but you also want to collect engineering-focused
projects here.</p>

<p>Each of these projects should include a short description of the
requirements and a description of its impact. As much as possible,
engineering and product-focused projects should describe impact should be in the
language of the goals defined in step 1.  This will help make sure that all
projects are prioritized on equal terms.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Put estimates on all projects</h2>

<p>Once you have a list of projects and their impact, the next step is to put
estimates on them.  There are a variety of ways you can do this but, I've found
    that having the people close to the work give <a
                                                      href="https://explainagile.com/blog/t-shirt-size-estimation/">t-shirt
                                                      sized estimates</a> is a
                                                  good approach here.  T-shirt
                                                  sizes are nice for this
                                                  because they give high and
                                                  low estimates, which
                                                  appropriately convey
                                                  uncertainty, and they can be
                                                  assigned quickly.</p>

<p>At this stage, you'll also want to allow for a little bit of push-and-pull on
requirements.  If there are ways to deliver a subset of the project at a
fraction of the cost, you'll want to surface that now so that you can
incorporate that information in later stages of planning.  However, you don't want to
negotiate over specific requirements at this stage, as that can quickly become a
time-sink.</p>

<p>Once you've done this, you should have a spreadsheet that looks something
like <a
         href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A_kiYX1x4mUVD4kiCEuw22xe2YcyhVFJ4M2hjnUdmo8/edit#gid=1613272465">the
         second sheet in our example.</a></p>

<h2>Step 4: Figure out your capacity</h2>

<p>Now you've got projects, impact, and estimates.  The last input we need
for a plan is an understanding how much the team can accomplish.
Having historical velocity to calibrate against is best, but in the absence of
that you can get by with taking the number of staff-weeks available on your team
and applying a consistent haircut for things like PTO, on-call, and
high-priority small tasks.</p>

<p>If you want to more accurately assess team capacity, Steve McConnell's <a
    href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Estimation-Demystifying-Developer-Practices/dp/0735605351">Software
    Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art</a> has a number of good techniques.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Establish your overall plan</h2>

<p>Now we have all the inputs into our plan, the last step is to actually make
it.  The simplest way to do this is to start filling up your team's queue with
the "best" projects (probably defined as highest impact-effort ratio) until the
sum of their high estimates is equal to team capacity.  These are your "green"
projects: the ones you'll plan around for the quarter.</p>

<p>Then, keep stack-ranking the remaining projects until the sum of their
low-estimates equals the team's capacity.  These are your "yellow" projects; the
ones you'll work on if things go well, but will get cut depending on how the
quarter goes.</p>

<p>Finally, you'll have a bunch of projects that don't make the cut.  These are
"red" projects, and they just won't happen this quarter unless something
changes.</p>

<p>After this step, you should have something that looks like <a
                                                                  href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A_kiYX1x4mUVD4kiCEuw22xe2YcyhVFJ4M2hjnUdmo8/edit#gid=7959846">the
                                                                  third sheet in
                                                              our example.</a>
</p>

<h2>Step 6: Sanity check with a Gannt Chart</h2>

<p>Once we have a plan, I like to check the results by making a quick <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart">gannt chart.</a> The
purpose of this is sanity check your assumptions and look for anything you'll
need to plan around, <em>not</em> to make a strict
schedule you'll follow for the quarter.  It will probably accurately reflect
your team's work over the next ~4-6 weeks, but will become more speculative
after that.</p>

<p>After adjusting your gannt chart for things like deadlines and staffing
    requirements, you'll end up with something like <a
    href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A_kiYX1x4mUVD4kiCEuw22xe2YcyhVFJ4M2hjnUdmo8/edit#gid=769496698">the
    final sheet in our example spreadsheet.</a> Congratulations, you've got a quarterly plan!</p>

<h2>Step 7: Share a narrative of your plan</h2>

<p>Now that you've got a plan, chances are other people in your company will
care about it.  You could share the spreadsheet you used to make the plan, but
that's not easily digestible.  Instead, you'll probably want to
turn your plan into a narrative document.  There are lots of ways
to do this, but I like to follow Guarav Oberoi's <a
                                                     href="https://goberoi.com/on-writing-product-roadmaps-a4d72f96326c">Medium
                                                     post on building product
                                                 roadmaps</a> as a default
                                             approach.  His process for getting
                                             to a roadmap is slightly different,
                                             but the end product can be
                                             identical.</p>

<p>Sharing this out in a narrative format can also help other teams understand
what you're accomplishing and allow them to easily give feedback if you're
missing any assumptions.</p>

<h2>What are the strengths and weaknesses of this approach?</h2>

<p>Overall I've found this approach to be effective for understanding what a
team of ~4-8 people can build over a ~3 month time horizon, which makes it
perfect for quarterly planning for a feature team where you don't need
crystal-clear accuracy over for the quarter.</p>

<p>At the same time, this approach isn't a panacea.  In particular, it has a few
limitations: 
    <ul> 
        <li> It hand-waves over external dependencies.  This means that if
            you're in an environment where you have a lot of dependencies, you
            may want a broader process similar to this <a
            href="https://firstround.com/review/the-secret-to-a-great-planning-process-lessons-from-airbnb-and-eventbrite/">"W-shaped"</a>
            approach.  If nothing else, it makes sense to follow Guarav's advice
            of making sure to call out dependencies as a risk in your
            narrative.</li> 
        <li>It doesn't give super accurate estimates or
            clear project plans, especially if you estimate with t-shirt sizes.
            I've found this to be mostly fine since our main goal
            with this process is to establish "what work can we plausibly do",
            not a perfect schedule.  Once we've established the work we
            can take on, then we can start to manage individual projects
            and create a more accurate schedule.
        </li> 
        <li>It starts to break down past ~3 months.  The lack of dependency
            tracking and rough estimation approaches means this is fine for ~1
            quarter, but not much further than that.  If
            you need planning past the quarter-level, consider other
            approaches.
        </li> 
    </ul> 
</p>

<p>In spite of these limitations, I've found that running this process is a
great way to cut through ambiguity and get a quarterly plan pretty quickly.
It's my default tool when I need to run a planning process, and would recommend
it to others who are just getting started with quarterly planning.</p>
