Outline:

Big Idea: Peak helped me become a better engineer by showing me that I needed
specific ideas of what to improve, specific exercises to improve them, and
feedback mechanisms.


Three points:
i. Peak is a book by Anders Ericson which comes with a very simple idea: you
become better at something by building practicing specific skills and getting
feedback for how that practice went.
ii. That type of idea is rarely intentionally applied to software engineering
    a. Knowledge vs. Skills Dichotomy
    b. We frequently focus on the accumulation of knowledge, which is valuable,
    but it's only valuable in the service of skills. Note study about doctors not
    actually becoming better doctors in spite of going to lots of conferences.
    c. Learning knowledge is also MUCH easier than accumulating skills. 
iii. How can we do that?
    a. First, define specific skills that people need to acquire.
    b. Then we need to define a series of exercises that allow us to do that
    c. Devise feedback mechanisms
iv. Examples!
    1. Generating multiple solutions of various technical costs 
        Exercise: Before implementing a change, you could ask yourself to make
        a list of all the ways a solution, and share it with a co-worker.
        Feedback: Share your list with a teammate, ask if they have any ideas
        about other ways that you may have missed 
    2. Ability to design systems in a simple, testable way
        Exercise: Take a look at an existing codebase. Write down the major
        components and describe how they would fit together in a more testable
        way along with their APIs.
        Feedback: Sketch out a test plan given the APIs you described.  How well
        could those be tested?
    3. Ability to communicate in a clear, succint way for a variety of audiences
        Exercise: Take a complicated technical topic from your team.  Write up
        short descriptions for each audience.
        Feedback: If you're brave: ask someone to explain them back to you.  If
        not, are you able to spend less time clarifying ideas?
    4. Ability to read a code review and make sure it has adequate code
        coverage 
        Exercise: Write up a test plan for a change after reviewing code but
        before you review its tests. 
        Feedback: Are all those test cases covered by the change?  Are there any
        changes that the author added, but you missed.
v. Conclusion
    a. Peak gives a clear idea of how to get better at something, and it has
    pushed me to become more concrete in how I approach my own growth as an
    engineer.  I hope that more conferences and companies use its lessons in
    order to teach skills to engineers rather than relying purely on
    knowledge-based teaching.
