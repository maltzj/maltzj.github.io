title: Some Tricks To Make You More Productive 
---

<p>Every developer has their own little kit of productivity tools  which they
constantly expand over time.  Unfortunately, I've found that the only way these
tools get shared is when someone has a problem someone else pipes up "Hey, I
know how to do that!", and passes on their tribal knowledge, only for it to be
lost until the next person has the same problem.  In the spirit of "sharing
stuff I wish I'd known last year", I wanted to share some neat things I've
discovered over the past couple of months which have helped me solve various
problems.</p>

<p>Before getting started, I deliberately haven't gone into the nitty gritty of how
this stuff works/is configured.  Once you know that most of this stuff exists,
actually configuring it is pretty easy.</p>

<h3>Git's -w flag</h3>

<p>Ever found yourself looking at a git diff and seen hundreds of lines of changes
which were only whitespace?  Did your team's recent switch from tabs to spaces
make git blame useless?  If so, it's -w flag to the rescue!</p>

<p>When using git blame, git show, or git diff (and possibly more), the -w flag
will ignore whitespace changes, making it easy to find the proper person to yell
at for the bug they introduced.</p>

<h3>Git log -G</h3>

<p>Sometimes you find yourself looking at a file that seems to have undergone all
sorts of wacky transformations such that just using git blame/show doesn't tell the
full story. What you really need is a full history of that file so you can trace
the commits.  In these cases, git log -G is what you're looking for.</p>

<p>This command will look through all of the diffs of your commits, and only return
those that have a particular string in them.  You can use this to look for
particular symbols that were modified, or you can just look for file names, as
those are also included in diffs.  Searching for file names is especially nice
because you don't need to put the fully qualified path of the file you want,
just the base name will do.</p>

<p>There are also more tools to look through your commit history which give you
more fine-grained control over how you search.  These two flags are -S and
--grep, and the difference between these are summed up nicely in <a

StackOverflow comment</a></p>

<h3>Configuring /etc/hosts for maximum productivity</h3>

<p>If you've done any web development, you're definitely used to configuring
virtual hosts by editing your /etc/hosts file.  Over the past couple of months
though I've started using it for an additional purpose: keeping myself focused.  In
addition to all of my virtual hosts, I have also re-routed Twitter, Facebook,
and Reddit all to localhost.</p>

<p>Before doing this I'd often find myself checking Reddit "just for a minute" and
then 30 minutes later I'd be way off track, looking at a bunch of mediocre cat
memes. Now, if I want to get on Reddit or Facebook, I need to take a couple of
conscious steps to edit my /etc/hosts file and unblock that website.</p>

<p>It isn't too much of a hassle, so I can still easily test stuff like
Facebook/Twitter sharing, but it's enough friction that I don't find myself
aimlessly wandering to my twitter feed.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> this also works really well if you need to study for finals and find
yourself constantly distracted by Tetris Friends a la Gerard O'Neill.</p>

<h3>Pycharm Remote Debugging</h3>

<p>Over at Yelp, all of our API development is done on remote machines. While this
solves some infrastructure problems, it also creates some others. One of the
biggest, especially for API developers is "how the hell do you debug stuff?"  Printing is one option,
but sometimes you need something more powerful, and that's where Pycharm remote
debugging comes in.</p>

<p>With remote debugging you can insert a couple of lines of code into any file, drop
in a breakpoint, and then run my code as normal.  Whenever that breakpoint gets
hit, the remote code will connect to my local Pycharm instance, and connect to
the debugger as if the code was running locally.</p>

<p>Once connected, you can debug the code as if it were running locally.  You can
step into method calls, examine program state, and drop in further breakpoints
just as if your code were running locally.  If you're used to visual debuggers
from other IDEs this is truly a god-send.</p>

<h3>IntelliJ Live Templates</h3>

<p>No matter what language you write in, there are always code blocks that you find
yourself continually writing.  IntelliJ live templates are the end of this.
With live templates, you cobble together a bunch of code that you are
continually writing (e.g. the 3-line code block which sets up Pycharm remote
debugging) and assign it to a shorthand notation.</p>

<p>Next, when you want to drop that particular code block somewhere, you can call
up your list of live templates, start typing out your template's assigned name
and then get it completed as if it were just another function name.</p>

<p>But wait! In case adding 5-lines of code with 4 keystrokes wasn't enough, you
can also customize live templates so that parts of them are variable.  This is
incredibly useful if you often write something like Log.e(TAG,
"random_debug_statement").</p>

<p>By using live templates, you can assign that whole statement to one live
template, called LE.  Then, when you insert the LE template, your cursor will be
put right in the quotes where you'd write your debug statement. You can also go
crazy and have live templates with multiple variables and just tab through to
insert text where appropriate.  You have never felt like such a master of your
code.</p>

<p>Those are all the neat little tricks I've picked up for now. Over the next
couple of weeks I'll (finally) be digging into Android Studio and Espresso for
HN, so hopefully that will lead to all sorts of productivity goodness in the
wake of my first Google I/O.</p>
