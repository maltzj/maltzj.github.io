title: Why I Write Weekly Notes
---

<p>I have kept a weekly (or bi-weekly) Confluence blog at Stripe for the better part of 4
years now.  Every once and a while people ask why I do that.  Here's what I tell
them.</p>

<ul> <li><b>It helps in performance review season: </b> It's hard to remember
        everything you did when performance review season rolls around.  Having
        a weekly blog of your work helps you easily catch up on documents I
        wrote, decisions I drove, and overall successes.  </li> <li><b>It allows
            me to should people out: </b> I want to make sure people know that I
        saw the fact that they did good work and I really appreciate it.
        Tagging people in a weekly blog post via Confluence is a great low-key
        way to say "I saw you and enjoyed what you did".  It also helps me
        elevate neat things that I think are valuable to lots of people.  I try
        to be especially mindful of doing this with more junior engineers or
        underrepresented folks.</li> <li><b>It helps create ambient awareness of
        my work: </b> My interests tend to be pretty broad.  Broadcasting notes
    creates awareness of where I'm focusing so that others can find me and
    potentially either help me out or we can work together to connect our work
        into a coherent whole.  In other words, it helps increase my <a

            surface area</a></li> <li><b>It helps me organize my thoughts: </b>
        Writing is thinking.  Good ideas don't emerge from my brain on the first
            try.  That's not how my brain works.  I need to process a lot of
            thoughts out loud or at my keyboard in order to get all the
            messiness straight in my own brain.  By keeping a weekly blog it
            gives me a place to dump down those initial thoughts and sketch out
            rough drafts to refine them.  This helps me get to a clearer final
            story.  I also like to think it helps others see that staff
            engineers aren't some impossibly brilliant people who come up with
            things out of thin air.  We're humans who bumble through problems to
    get to the right place, just like everyone else.</li> </ul>

<p>So far those work for me.  The habit is valuable enough for me to keep it up
for a few years.  Maybe it will be useful for you too.</p>
