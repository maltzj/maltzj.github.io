title: A Boring Approach to Quarterly Planning 
---

<p>Teams often find themselves in a position where they need to figure out how much
work they can commit to, most commonly in quarterly planning.  If you've never
done this before, it can feel overwhelming, as you need to wade through a world
of possibilities to get to a commitment.  Fortunately, I've found that a default
approach can help you answer these questions reasonably quickly and with minimal
overhead.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Figure out your goals</h2>

<p>Before you go figuring out what your team should build, you need to figure
out what your goals are.  In Silicon Valley, this frequently looks like defining
OKRs, but any goal setting framework will do.  What's important is that you have
some yardstick you can use to measure the impact of possible projects.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Make a list of projects to achieve and their impact</h2>

<p>Once you have your goals, the next step is to write down all your possible
projects and their impact. In the interest of keeping the list manageable, a
"project"  is something that will take >= 2 staff-weeks of work. Most of these
will be user-facing features, but you also want to collect engineering-focused
projects here.</p>

<p>Each of these projects should include a three things: a short description of
the must-have, a description of nice-to-have features and a description of its
impact. As much as possible, the engineering and product-focused projects should
describe impact should be in the language of the goals defined in step 1.  This
will help make sure that all projects are prioritized on equal terms.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Put Estimate ranges on all projects</h2>

<p>Once you have a list of projects and their impact, the next step is to put
estimates on them.  There are a variety of ways you can do this, but in general,
    I've found that having the people close to the eventual work give <a
        href="https://explainagile.com/blog/t-shirt-size-estimation/">t-shirt
        sized estimates</a> is a good approximation.  This gives a "good enough"
    set of estimate ranges and it can be done pretty quickly.</p>

<p>If you need more accurate estimates, it's worth reading Steve McConell's <a
    href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Estimation-Demystifying-Developer-Practices-ebook/dp/B00JDMPOVQ">Software
    Estimation: Demystifying the Dark Art</a> for a full list of techniques you
can use.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Figure out your capacity</h2>

<p>Now you've got projects, impact, and estmiates.  The last thing we need
before finalizing our plan is to understand what the team can actually
accomplish.  Having historical velocity to calibrate against is best, but in the
absence of that you can get by with taking the number of staff-weeks available
on your team, and applying a consistent haircut for things like PTO, on-call,
and high-priority small tasks.</p>

<p>Again, Steve Mconnell's book has a ton of great approaches you can use
depending on your team and projects.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Establish your overall plan</h2>

<p>Now we have all the inputs into our plan, the last step is to actually make
it.  The simplest way to do this is to start filling up your team's queue with
the "best" projects (probably defined as highest impact-effort ratio) until
their the sum of their high estimates is equal to team capacity.  These are your
"green" projects: the ones you'll plan around for the quarter.</p>

<p>Then, keep stack-ranking the remaining projects until the sum of their
low-estimates equals the team's capacity.  These are your "yellow" projects; the
ones you'll work on if things go well, but will get cut depending on how well
you deliver your other projects.</p>

<p>Finally, you'll have a bunch of projects that don't make the cut.  These are
"red" projects, and they just won't happen this quarter unless something
changes.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Sanity check with a Gannt Chart</h2>

<p>Once we have a plan, I like to sanity check the approach by making a quick
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart">Gannt chart.</a>  This
version of a gannt chart is intentionally low-resolution, but it serves to
sanity check your assumptions.  For example: are your projects super heavy on FE
needs this quarter, so you'll need to make sure to manage risks around your
senior FE engineers' projects?  Those types of questions don't come out when
just stack ranking numbers, but when you plot the projects out, you can quickly
see problematic patterns.</p>

<p>If you see something scary, tweak your plan slightly until you're happy with
the results. Congratulations, you've got a quarterly plan!</p>

<h2>Step 7: Share a narrative of your plan</h2>

<p>Now that you've got a plan, chances are other people in your company will
care about it.  You could share out the spreadsheet you use to stack rank
projects, but that's not easily digestible.  Instead, you'll probably want to
turn your plan into some kind of a narrative document.  There are lots of ways
   to do this, but I like to follow Guarav Oberoi's <a
       href="https://goberoi.com/on-writing-product-roadmaps-a4d72f96326c">Medium
       post on building product roadmaps</a> as a default approach.  His process
   for getting to a roadmap is slightly different, but the end product can be
   identical.</p>

<p>Sharing this out in a narrative format can also help other teams understand
what you're accomplishing and allow them to easily give feedback if you're
missing any assumptions.</p>

<h2>What are the strengths and weaknesses of this approach?</h2>

<p>Overall I've found this approach to be effective for understanding what a
team of ~4-8 people can build over a ~3 month time horizon, which makes it
perfect for quarterly planning for a feature team.  It won't give you perfect
results, but once you've defined goals you can get a reasonable plan in 1-2
weeks of intermittent work.</p>

<p>At the same time, this approach isn't a panacea.  In particular, it has a few
limitations: 

    <ul> 
        <li>
            It hand-waves over external dependencies.  This means that
        if you're in an environment where you have a lot of complex
        dependencies, you may need a more formal planning process.  If nothing
        else, it makes sense to follow Guarav's advice of making sure to call
        out dependencies as a risk in step 6.  
        </li> 
        <li> 
            It doesn't give super
        accurate estimates, especially if you estimate with t-shirt sizes.  I've
        found that's mostly-fine for my use-cases, but could be an issue
        depending on your environment.  
        </li> 
        <li> It starts to break down past ~3
        months.  The lack of dependency tracking and estimate rigor means this
        is fine for ~1 quarter, but it means that your more distant estimations
        will likely be more wrong.  If you need clear planning past the
        quarter-level, consider other approaches.  
        </li>
</ul> 
</p>
