title: A Boring Approach to Quarterly Planning 
---

<p>Teams often find themselves in a position where they need to figure out how much
work they can commit to, most commonly in quarterly planning.  If you've never
done this before, it can feel overwhelming, as you need to wade through a world
of possibilities to get to a commitment.  Fortunately, I've found that a default
approach can help you answer these questions reasonably quickly and with minimal
overhead.</p>

<p>Before going further, I've created an example of this process for a
theoretical food delivery company in <a
                                                                        href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A_kiYX1x4mUVD4kiCEuw22xe2YcyhVFJ4M2hjnUdmo8/edit#gid=0">this
                                                                        spreadsheet.</a>
Take a few minutes to review that before reading the rest.</p>

<p>Have you read through the spreadsheet?  Great. Let's move into the
details.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Figure out your goals</h2>

<p>Before you go figuring out what to build this quarter, what you're trying to
achieve.  In Silicon Valley, this frequently looks like defining OKRs, but any
goal setting framework will do.  What's important is that you have some common
yardstick to measure each project's impact and prevent the loudest opinion from
dictating what the team will work on.</p>

<p>If you're not sure how to get started with setting good goals, <a
    href="https://upraise.io/blog/writing-effective-okrs/">this blog post is a
    good place to get started.</a>

<h2>Step 2: Make a list of projects to achieve and their impact</h2>

<p>Once you have your goals, the next step is to write down all your possible
projects and their impact. In the interest of keeping the list manageable, a
"project"  is something that will take > 1 staff-weeks of work. Most of these
will be user-facing features, but you also want to collect engineering-focused
projects here.</p>

<p>Each of these projects should include a two things: a short description of
the requirements and a description of its impact. As much as possible, the
engineering and product-focused projects should describe impact should be in the
language of the goals defined in step 1.  This will help make sure that all
projects are prioritized on equal terms.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Put Estimate ranges on all projects</h2>

<p>Once you have a list of projects and their impact, the next step is to put
estimates on them.  There are a variety of ways you can do this but, I've found
    that having the people close to the work give <a
        href="https://explainagile.com/blog/t-shirt-size-estimation/">t-shirt
        sized estimates</a> is sufficient for this process. T-shirt sizes give
    good-enough estimates, and can be assigned fairly quickly.</p>

<p>At this stage, you'll also want to allow for a little bit of push-and-pull on
requirements.  If there are ways to deliver a subset of the project at a
fraction of the cost, you'll want to surface that now so that you can
incorporate that in later stages of planning.  However, you don't want to
negotiate over specific requirements at this stage, as that can quickly become a
time-sink.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Figure out your capacity</h2>

<p>Now you've got projects, impact, and estmiates.  The last thing we need
before finalizing our plan is to understand what the team can actually
accomplish.  Having historical velocity to calibrate against is best, but in the
absence of that you can get by with taking the number of staff-weeks available
on your team, and applying a consistent haircut for things like PTO, on-call,
and high-priority small tasks.</p>

<p>Steve McConnell's <a
    href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Estimation-Demystifying-Developer-Practices/">Software
    Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art</a> has a number of good techniques
if you want to more accurately assess team capacity.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Establish your overall plan</h2>

<p>Now we have all the inputs into our plan, the last step is to actually make
it.  The simplest way to do this is to start filling up your team's queue with
the "best" projects (probably defined as highest impact-effort ratio) until
their the sum of their high estimates is equal to team capacity.  These are your
"green" projects: the ones you'll plan around for the quarter.</p>

<p>Then, keep stack-ranking the remaining projects until the sum of their
low-estimates equals the team's capacity.  These are your "yellow" projects; the
ones you'll work on if things go well, but will get cut depending on how the
quarter goes.</p>

<p>Finally, you'll have a bunch of projects that don't make the cut.  These are
"red" projects, and they just won't happen this quarter unless something
changes.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Sanity check with a Gannt Chart</h2>

<p>Once we have a plan, I like to sanity check the approach by making a quick <a

<p>If you see something scary, tweak your plan slightly until you're happy with
the results. Congratulations, you've got a quarterly plan!</p>

<h2>Step 7: Share a narrative of your plan</h2>

<p>Now that you've got a plan, chances are other people in your company will
care about it.  You could share out the spreadsheet you use to stack rank
projects, but that's not easily digestible.  Instead, you'll probably want to
turn your plan into some kind of a narrative document.  There are lots of ways
to do this, but I like to follow Guarav Oberoi's <a
                                                     href="https://goberoi.com/on-writing-product-roadmaps-a4d72f96326c">Medium
                                                     post on building product
                                                 roadmaps</a> as a default
                                             approach.  His process for getting
                                             to a roadmap is slightly different,
                                             but the end product can be
                                             identical.</p>

<p>Sharing this out in a narrative format can also help other teams understand
what you're accomplishing and allow them to easily give feedback if you're
missing any assumptions.</p>

<h2>What are the strengths and weaknesses of this approach?</h2>

<p>Overall I've found this approach to be effective for understanding what a
team of ~4-8 people can build over a ~3 month time horizon, which makes it
perfect for quarterly planning for a feature team.  It won't give you perfect
results, but once you've defined goals you can get a reasonable plan in 1-2
weeks.</p>

<p>At the same time, this approach isn't a panacea.  In particular, it has a few
limitations: 

    <ul> <li> It hand-waves over external dependencies.  This means that if
            you're in an environment where you have a lot of dependencies, you
            may want a broader process similar to this <a

            approach.  If nothing else, it makes sense to follow Guarav's advice
            of making sure to call out dependencies as a risk in your
            narrative.</li> <li> It doesn't give super accurate estimates or
            clear project plans, especially if you estimate with t-shirt sizes.
            I've found that's mostly-fine for my use-cases, But it means that
            you'll need to have a separate plan to actually deliver projects and
            control schedules.  </li> <li> It starts to break down past ~3
            months.  The lack of dependency tracking and estimate rigor means
            this is fine for ~1 quarter, but it means that your more distant
            estimations will likely be more wrong.  If you need clear planning
            past the quarter-level, consider other approaches.  </li> </ul> </p>

<p>In spite of these limitations, I've found that running this process is a
great way to cut through ambiguity and get a quarterly plan pretty quickly.
It's my default tool when I need to run a planning process, and would recommend
it to others who are just getting started with quarterly planning.</p>
