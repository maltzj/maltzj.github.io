title: A Boring Approach to Long-term Planning 
---


Big idea: Write down the list of things you want to do, SWAG impact + effort,
create a list of people , do math to determine overall possibility

Point 1: Oftentimes you need to get an a sense of what work a team can do and
how they should do it.  Perfection is not important, but getting _an answer is_
Point 2: Get a list of projects w/ requirements and expected impact.  Give to
engineers to prioritize
Point 3: Then, you can do simple math to get some answers

<p>Teams often find themselves in a position where they need to figure out how much
work they can commit to.  This commonly occurs during a quarterly planning, but
it can also show up if you're running a long project and trying to figure out
how to hit your next milestone.  I've found that a default approach canhelp you
answer these questions reasonably quickly and with minimal overhead..</p>

<h2>Step 1: Figure out your goals</h2>

<p>Before you go figuring out what your team should build, you need to figure
out what your goals are.  In Silicon Valley, this frequently looks like defining
OKRs, but any goal setting framework will do.  What's important is that you have
some yardstick you can use to measure the impact of possible projects.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Make a list of projects to achieve and their impact</h2>

<p>Once you have your goals, the next step is to write down all the projects you
could take on and their impact. In the interest of making sure this list doesn't
become enourmous, a "project"  is something that will take > 2 staff-weeks of
work, or projects that must be completed by the team. Most of these projects will be
user-facing and come from product managers, but you also want to collect
engineering-focused projects which improve scalability.</p>

<p>Each of these projects should include a few things: a short description of
the must-have and nice-to-have features (often ~1 paragraph), and a description
of its impact. As much as possible, the impact should be in the language of the
teams' goals. This will help make sure that all projects are prioritized on
equal terms.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Put Estimate ranges on all projects</h2>

<p>Once you have a list of projects and their impact, the next step is to put
estimates on all of the projects.  There are a variety of ways you can do this
depending on how accurate you need your estimates to be.  In general, I've found
that the best approach is to involve the people closest to the work in creating
<a href="https://explainagile.com/blog/t-shirt-size-estimation/">t-shirt sized
    estimates</a>.  This gives a "good enough" set of estimate ranges and it can
be done pretty quickly.</p>

<p>If you need more accurate estimates, it's worth reading Steve McConell's <a                                                                               
    href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Estimation-Demystifying-Developer-Practices-ebook/dp/B00JDMPOVQ">Software
    Estimation: Demystifying the Dark Art</a> for a full list of techniques you
can use.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Figure out your capacity</h2>

<p>Now you've got projects, impact, and estmiates.  The last thing we need
before finalizing our plan is to understand what the team can actually
accomplish.  Having historical velocity to calibrate against is best, but in
the absence of that you can get by with taking the number of staff-weeks
available on your team, and applying a haircut for things like PTO and
on-call.</p>

<p>Again, Steve Mconnell's book has a ton of great approaches you can use
depending on your team and projects.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Establish your overall plan</h2>

<p>Now we have projects, impact, estimates, and capacity.  All that's left is to
put them together and actually make an overall plan.  The simplest way to do
this is to start filling up your team's queue with the "best" projects (probably
defined as highest impact-effort ratio) until their the sum of their high
estimates is equal to team capacity.  These are your "green" projects: the ones you'll plan around
for the quarter.</p>

<p>Then, keep stack-ranking the remaining projects until the sum of their
low-estimates equals the team's capacity.  These are your "yellow" projects; the
ones you'll work on if things go well, but will get cut depending on how well
you deliver your other projects.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Share a narrative of your plan</h2>

<p>Now that you've got a plan, chances are other people in your company will
care about it.  You can do most of the above steps in a spreadsheet, but you'll
want to share it with others in a narrative.  For guidance on how to do this
well, I'd suggest Guarav Oberoi's <a 
    href="https://goberoi.com/on-writing-product-roadmaps-a4d72f96326c">Medium 
    post on building product roadmaps.</a>  He outlines a slightly different
process for building a roadmap, but the output should be pretty similar.</p>


<h2>What are the strengths and weaknesses of this approach?</h2>

<p>Overall I've found this approach to be effective for understanding what a
team of ~6-10 people can build over a ~3 month time horizon, which makes it
perfect for quarterly planning.  It can accomplish that pretty quickly: ~1-2
weeks once your goals and high-level projects are defined.</p>

<p>At the same time, this approach isn't a panacea.  In particular, it has a few
limitations:
<ul>
    <li>It hand-waves over external dependencies.  This means that if you're in
        an environment where you have a lot of complex dependencies, you may
        need a more formal planning process.  If nothing else, it makes sense to
        follow Guarav's advice of making sure to call out dependencies as a risk
        in step 6.
    </li>
    <li>It doesn't give super accurate estimates, especially if you estimate
        with t-shirt sizes.  I've found that's mostly-fine for most use-cases,
        but could be an issue depending on how you use it.
    </li>
    <li>
        It starts to break down past ~3 months.  The lack of dependency tracking
        and estimate rigor means this is fine for ~1 quarter, but it means that
        your more distant estimations will likely be more wrong.  If you need
        clear planning past the quarter-level, consider more formal project
        planning approaches.
    </li>
</ul>
