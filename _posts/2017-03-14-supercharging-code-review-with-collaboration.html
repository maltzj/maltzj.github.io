title: Supercharging your Code Review With Collaboration
---

<p>Software engineers always talk about how code reviews are <a
    href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-reviews-just-do-it/">the single biggest
thing to improve your code quality</a>, but we often forget that putting your
hard-written code up for review can be scary. We invest a lot of time in making
sure that our code is perfect, so submitting it to someone for their critique
can feel like putting part of our identity up for critique.</p>
<p>Fortunately for you, prospective code reviewer, there’s something you can do
to help. By being conscious of the language you use when suggesting revisions,
you can preemptively allay the concerns of your reviewee and supercharge your
code reviews. Best of all, it only requires tweaking a few phrases in your
vocabulary.</p>
<h3>Getting started: Focus your critical feedback on the code, not the people
    who wrote the code.</h3>
<p>One of the first keys to building safety as a reviewer is to make it clear
that any feedback you give is not about the code’s <em>author</em>, but rather a comment
on the code <em>itself</em>. This can seem complicated, but there’s a dead simple way to
get started accomplishing this: remove the word “you” from your code review
vocabulary.</p>
<p>It’s a little challenging to get started with this new, you-free lifestyle,
but you’ll find that it pays huge dividends. In fact, once you’re aware of it,
you’ll find the sneaky three letter word has been cropping up all over the
place, making situations adversarial when they should feel collaborative. Worst
of all, chances are, your “you’s” have probably been popping up when they’ve
actually been referring to the code all along!</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a fairly innocuous code review comment:</p>
<p><em>“You’ve really tightly coupled your classes here. That may cause some
    problems down the road.”</em></p>

<p>My heart skips a little when I read that, and I’m not even the one who wrote
the code! By immediately focusing on “you”, this comment can speak right to <a
    href="http://blog.startupinstitute.com/2016-09-08-overcoming-imposter-syndrome/">the
    little voice</a> which says “I’m no good because my code is no good”. Once that
little voice starts to talk, <a
    href="https://www.vitalsmarts.com/crucialskills/glossary/#q21">conversational
    safety</a> starts to go out the window,
and it’s taking collaboration right along with it.</p>

<p>Fortunately, in many cases, if you do a mental find/replace for “you” with
“the code”, you get something much more collaboration friendly, like:</p>
<p><em>“This code here looks really tightly coupled. That may cause some problems
    down the road”</em></p>
<p>Phew! Look at how much chest-tightness that eliminated. This comment no
longer references the code review author at all, and instead it only focuses on
something much more objective: the code itself. Now that we’ve shifted that
focus, we can employ a couple more techniques to make others receptive to your
feed back.</p>
<h3>Next Up: Think of your comments as suggestions, not dictations</h3>
<p>No one likes to be told what to do, and code review is no exception to this.
At the same time, one of your responsibilities as a reviewer is to get your
reviewee’s code to a place that your team is comfortable shipping it, which
sometimes requires getting them to change things they may feel attached to.</p>
<p>How to resolve this tension? Try not to make your comments dictations but
rather suggestions which open up space for discussion. To look at how we can do
this, let’s continue with our well-intentioned feedback from above, but this
time with a slight modification.</p>
<p><em>“The code here looks really tightly coupled. It should be refactored into
    class A and Class B”</em></p>
<p>This statement scores high marks for focusing on the code, but it could use
some improvement in the collaboration department by dictating the solution to a
problem. This comment may be correct, but it pushes the discussion into a realm
where it may seem like you’re forced to make <a
    href="https://www.vitalsmarts.com/crucialskills/glossary/#q27">the fool’s
    choice</a>. If the only
options presented are “keep the code as it stands” or “take your reviewer’s
suggestion” then there’s not an obvious space to agree with the premise (tight
coupling) but propose a new solution.</p>
<p>Much like our safety-building find/replace, the way to avoid this trap is
fairly simple: rephrase your suggestion from a dictation to a question about a
particular direction. Applying that transformation to our above comment, we get
a comment that looks like:</p>
<p><em>“The code here looks really tightly coupled. What if it got refactored it
    into class A and class B?”</em></p>
<p>Holy moly! What a difference three words and a punctuation change makes!
Instantly upon reading this question, you probably started trying to answer this
question in your head, and we don’t even have anything real to refactor! Just
imagine if we were talking about a real code review!</p>
<p>Maybe the end result of this is that you move in the suggested direction,
maybe you don’t do anything, or maybe you find some third path that makes
everyone satisfied. Regardless of the direction, what was once a code review
commandment is now a full-blown code review collaboration.</p>
<p>But we’re not done yet, there’s still a final form that our code review can
evolve into, and all we need to do to make that happen is use one simple
word.</p>
<h3>Look for places to use “we” instead of “you”</h3>
<p>We talked above about how and why to avoid using “you” in code reviews, but
really we only suggested one possible other direction: talking about the code
directly. What’s a code reviewer to do when they actually need to refer to a
person then? In those cases, save yourself a character and swap your “you”s for
“we”</p>
<p>This matters because we live in a world of <a
    href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/collective.html">collective
    code ownership</a>, which means that any code that your teammate puts into
production immediately becomes everyone’s responsibility. If a change breaks at
2 AM, Pagerduty isn’t going to take the time to git blame the offending line;
it’s going to wake someone up, and that someone may be you.</p>
<p>This means that code review isn’t just a time to make sure that the code is
the best it can be. It’s a time to also make sure that it’s code that the whole
team is comfortable owning and maintaining. By using “we” in your code reviews,
it reminds everyone involved that the goal is creating a great end product for
the team. Plus, it’s super simple!</p>
<p>We can take our previous comment:</p>
<p><em>“The code here looks really tightly coupled. What if it got refactored it
    into class A and class B?”</em></p>
<p>And wordsmith it into</p>
<p><em>“The code here looks tightly coupled, which may come back and bite us
    down the line when we want to make changes. What if we refactor it now into
    class A and class B?”.</em></p>
<p>Wham! Not only have we given a rationale for why we’re suggesting a
particular change, but also we’ve communicated it in such a way that it’s clear
that both the author and reviewer feel like they’re on the same side. Both
parties want flexible, maintainable code, and this comment sets the two of them
up to work towards that goal together, rather than as adversaries.</p>
<p>With those three small changes: removing the word “you”, focusing on the
code, using “we”, and phrasing suggestions as questions, our code review
toolbelt has received a serious level-up. These new tools won’t immediately
change how your code review operates, but with continued application you’ll find
that an activity which was once an unproductive chore will turn into a valuable
opportunity to work with your team to help ship the best possible software.</p>
<p>That’s not a bad outcome for shuffling around a couple of words and changing
a punctuation mark.</p>
