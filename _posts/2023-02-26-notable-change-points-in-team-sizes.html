title: How Teams Change At Different Sizes 
---

<p>During my career I've had the chance to work on teams of a lot of different
sizes. During that time I've come to realize there are really six "buckets" of
team sizes.  At each bucket, ICs + team leads need to operate a little
differently in order to be successful within those teams.  The sizes are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>1 Person</b>: Do what you want, YOLO</li>
    <li><b>2 → 3 People</b>: An ideal small squad.  Team can stay in touch with
        daily slack-ups and maybe an ad-hoc meeting when necessary.  In a remote
        world you probably need a weekly sync, but in-person that may not be
        necessary.</li>
    <li><b>4 → 5 People</b>: The size at which "which get everyone into a room"
        is a productive strategy whenever you have a challenge.  This is the
        size at which one seems to be able to tech lead and  manage as well. 
        You probably need a weekly sprint planning meeting to get on the same
        page because you've split into two squads.  This also  conveniently
        lines up with the first of <a

                                                                                                                numbers.</a></li>
    <li><b>6 → 9 people</b>: The platonic team size.  One manager, eight
        engineers, maybe a product manager.  Order your two pizzas, appreciate
        the fact that you have a good balance of size and redundancy, and
        execute away.</li>
    <li><b>10 → 12 people</b>: Team has likely become a little sprawling but may
        not have an exact obvious cut point.  Often characterized by needing to
        share lots of context between people because of the broad scope, and a
        manager who is being pulled in a bunch of directions.  Team is strained,
        but not breaking.  Chances are ICs will be doing some "gap filling" to
        make sure the team communicates well here.</li>
    <li><b>13+ people</b>: GG.  This isn't even a team anymore; just an
        overwhelmed manager and a bunch of sub-teams who secretly need to break
        off, but they can't, either because there's no one to manage the right
        sub-teams or the boundaries between "what should be the sub-teams" are
        not clear.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, these aren't THE ONLY team models that exist, but I find them to
be generally useful baseline rules when thinking about "how should I operate
within a team"</p>
