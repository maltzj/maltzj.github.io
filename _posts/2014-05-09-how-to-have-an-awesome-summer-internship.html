title: How To Have An Awesome Summer Internship
--- 
<IMG SRC="/images/internship-talk/slide-1.png" NAME="graphics1">

<P>Last week I gave a talk at Rutgers about how to make the most out
of your summer internship. Over the past few years I've worked at a
fair variety of companies, and I've screwed up a lot in the process.
Before heading out into the world of a full-time engineer I wanted to
codify some of the lessons that I've learned in hopes that future
interns will be able to avoid some of the pitfalls I ran into.</P>
<IMG SRC="/images/internship-talk/slide-2.png" NAME="graphics2" />
<P>In case you randomly stumbled here and have no idea who I am: Hi!
I'm Jonathan. I'm a recent Rutgers grad who now works as an Android
engineer at Yelp. When I'm not doing that, I help make a Hacker News
reader called HN and occasionally fix up stuff in the Github app. I
also stay tuned into Rutgers by helping admin the Rutgers Hackathon
Club, a Facebook group where students and alumni hang out.</P>
<IMG SRC="/images/internship-talk/slide-3.png" NAME="graphics3" />

<P>Before getting started, I want to save people's time by mentioning
a couple things that I won't be talking about in these slides. For
one, I won't be talking about how to land your dream internship. The
reason for that is simple: I don't know how to land your dream
internship.</P>
<P>My strategy for getting an internship was to get really good
grades and then apply everywhere that would have me. That turned out
pretty well for me, but from what I understand that's not The Right
Way to get your dream internship.  Sadly, I can't speak to The Right
Way, but a bunch of other people have written some awesome stuff
about it.  Check that out at the links above.</P>
<P>The other thing I won't be talking about is how to land a
full-time offer after your internship, mostly because I think that's
a misguided goal for the summer. Spending your summer focused on
getting a full-time offer is putting the horse before the carriage in
my mind. Instead, spend your summer focusing on how to improve your
skills as a developer and then let good things follow. If you're
curious about how to land a full-time offer, ask your recruiter about
it, they'll be a way better resource than me anyway.</P>
<IMG SRC="/images/internship-talk/slide-4.png" NAME="graphics4" />

<P>Cool, now that that's out of the way, time to get into some of the
stuff that I will be talking about (the stuff that those puppies are
really excited about).</P>
<P>2/3 of what I'll be talking about is inside the workplace stuff:
what to expect, what you'll be learning, what to look out for, and
how to make the most out of your time as an intern. The other third
is stuff that I screwed up and how to avoid that yourself.</P>
<IMG SRC="/images/internship-talk/slide-5.png" NAME="graphics5" />

<P>With that in mind, I suppose it makes sense to define what exactly
makes an awesome internship. For me, the answer to that question is
two-fold.</P>
<P>First and foremost, an awesome internship will set you up for a
successful career over the long-term. Your first experience as a
full-time developer can feel like an overwhelmingly important
experience, but in the grand scheme of things it's just one small
time slice of a much larger career.</P>
<P>Instead of treating your internship as a make or break moment for
your career, look it as another opportunity to improve your craft.
Focus on soaking up all the knowledge you can from your teammates and
your environment. That way, when you get out of college you'll be
able to make a solid decision about where to work full-time.</P>
<P>At the same time, an internship experience be super serious all
the time (or arguably ever). During your summer You'll probably be
getting paid heaps of money to run around an exciting city, possibly
with support from your employer (if they have an official intern
program set up). Having an awesome internship is just as much about
experiencing the best parts of your temporary home as it is
professional development.</P>
<IMG SRC="/images/internship-talk/slide-6.png" NAME="graphics6"/>

<P>Before you get started interning, one thing to realize is that
many times during your summer you may feel like a dumb person in a
room full of experts. THAT'S OKAY. In fact, that's not only okay,
it's expected.</P>
<P>You're probably be put onto a team with a bunch of people who have
5+ years cutting code for a living. It would be ridiculous to expect
that you'd rock up and be coding at their level after a month of
experience professionally creating software.</P>
<P>You weren't hired with the expectation that you'll put out the
same quantity and quality of code as experienced engineers. Rather,
you were hired with the expectation that you'll struggle a bit and do
some bumbling around before figuring out how things work.</P>
<P>So don't feel bad when you have to ask &quot;how do I submit my
code for review&quot;, or if it subsequently gets shredded on review.
Those types of struggles are TOTALLY NORMAL and are part of the
growing process. Even the superhuman senior architect on your team
was once there too.</P>
<IMG SRC="/images/internship-talk/slide-7.png" NAME="graphics7" />

<P>Although you aren't expected to have flawless development skills,
you will want to take the opportunity to improve as much as possible
and learn as much as possible about how to become a better developer.</P>
<IMG SRC="/images/internship-talk/slide-8.png" NAME="graphics8" />

<P>The first half of improving your skills as a developer is
increasing your knowledge of all the technical stuff that goes into
making software. A lot of this will happen organically just because
you'll be reading, writing, and getting feedback on lots of code.
However, you can also take a couple of steps to supercharge your
learning.</P>
<P>First: actually read documentation. By read documentation I don't
mean &quot;open up the docs and press CTRL+F&quot;. That's not
reading documentation, that's playing the blind squirrel hoping to
find a nut. I mean actually take the time to sit down and read them
until you fully understand them.</P>
<P>It may feel weird and unproductive and weird to spend a full day
reading docs. Again, DON'T WORRY, spending 6 hours just reading docs
is TOTALLY NORMAL; hell, it's sometimes what you need to do to get
your job done. Remember, you aren't expected to know everything when
you get there, so the only way you're going to learn stuff is to
read.</P>
<P>Secondly: use your mentor to get you unstuck on problems. Chances
are you will have a mentor assigned to you, try to figure stuff out
on your own, but when you're stuck, ask him or her where to look
next.</P>
<P>At the same time, it can be a little bit of a guessing game when
to ask your mentor for help and when to dig a little deeper. My
general rule is to follow the method outlined in <A HREF="https://blogs.akamai.com/2013/10/you-must-try-and-then-you-must-ask.html">this
blog post</A>.</P>
<P>There's also the possibility that you won't have a mentor assigned
to you, if that's the case just grab a friendly full-timer and ask
them your question. Again, remember that asking questions doesn't
make you any less of a developer, we all need help sometimes.</P>
<P>Third: ask your mentor big picture questions that will help you
better understand how to develop large-scale systems. These are
questions like &quot;how is our X designed? Why is it designed that
way? What are some limitations of that?&quot;</P>
<P>One awesome strategy my friend Vaibhav uses to find these
questions is to write down any term he hears that he doesn't
understand down in a notebook. Then, once or twice a week he'd have
lunch with his mentor and just pepper him with questions about his
company's technology. Steal that or come up with your own strategy,
but whatever you do, figure out a way to learn about software
engineering from someone who has been doing it already.</P>
<IMG SRC="/images/internship-talk/slide-9.png" NAME="graphics9" />

<P>The second class of things to learn during your internship is how
you can improve your own tools and workflows.</P>
<P>During the course of your internship, you're going to run into a
lot of people who do things differently than you. Constantly be on
the lookout for these differences, and try to figure out how to steal
the good stuff for your own workflow.</P>
<P>As a rule, if you see someone with something that looks useful,
whether it's a cute keyboard shortcut or a random productivity tool,
you should ask them what they're using and how it helps them work
better. If their method seems like it would solve a problem that
you're having, head back to your desk and make a note to try it out.</P>
<P>Don't let this list languish. Block out time every week to improve
your own workflows. This time may be spent solving some of your own
pain points or it may be figuring out how to use the new hotness that
your mentor showed you last week. It may seem like a waste to not
spend every hour working on your intern project, but any investment
in your productivity now will pay big dividends over the long haul.</P>
<P>The other thing to be on the look-out for are the soft skills that
other developers posses. You'll undoubtedly run into people who are
awesome communicators and problem solvers. Many people who are great
at these two skills have systems or tricks that they use to be great.
If you find yourself impressed with how someone communicates, see if
you can recognize those systems and incorporate them yourself.</P>
<IMG SRC="/images/internship-talk/slide-10.png" NAME="graphics10" />

<P>The technical side of things is really only part of what you can
learn and get out of your internship. There is also a wealth of
non-technical things that you can pick up during your summer which
will serve you well.</P>
<IMG SRC="/images/internship-talk/slide-11.png" NAME="graphics11" />

<P>Once of the biggest things I screwed up during my first two
internships was being asocial. I would show up to work, eat lunch at
my desk, and then head home every day with barely a peep to my
coworkers. Both times this turned out to be a terrible decision, as
it resulted in me being burned out and dreading work by the end of my
internship.</P>
<P>At Yelp!, I decided to flip the script and actually take some time
away from my desk. I joked around with my teammates, played foosball
with other interns, and staunchly refused to eat lunch at my desk,
even if it meant eating by myself at 3 PM in the park.</P>
<P>The difference was massive. Every day I felt like I had energy to
solve problems, and when I started to feel down I could always find
someone who could help give my mind a break. Most importantly, I
never woke up dreading going into Yelp, which was a huge boost for
both my happiness and my productivity.</P>
<P>It can be tempting to spend your entire summer with a laser like
focus on your terminal (especially if you're focused on getting a FT
offer), but trust me, DON'T DO IT. Not only should be a FT offer not
be the focus of your internship, but also you'll be happier and more
productive if you step away from the computer every now and again.</P>
<IMG SRC="/images/internship-talk/slide-12.png" NAME="graphics12" />

<P>Besides learning to take breaks, the most important non-technical
thing you can learn during your internship is what matters to you in
a company culture. It's easy to think of this as &quot;is a company
filled with cool people?&quot;, but there's so much more to it than
that.</P>
<P>Culture is questions like &quot;is this environment comfortable
for me?&quot;, &quot;if I feel uncomfortable, do I have an avenue to
fix that?&quot;, &quot;am I cool when/where/the amount I'm expected
to work?”, and many more. One of the best articles I've read on
this subject is <A HREF="https://medium.com/p/4bbf84c55dbf">Where To
Work</A>, which gives a great breakdown of the types of cultural
values that are universally important.</P>
<P>If your company hits high notes on those types of big picture
questions, then you'll have a good time working there even if it
isn't filled with your BFFs. However, if you're working with a bunch
of &quot;cool people&quot; with unsatisfactory answers to these
questions, then it may not turn out well over the long haul.</P>
<P>Whether or not your summer is spent working with cool people, be
on the look-out for whether you're working somewhere that has a
culture that you fit with. Understand what it means to fit somewhere
vs. not fit somewhere, and figure out what questions you can ask of
future opportunities to figure out where you'd fit.</P>
<IMG SRC="/images/internship-talk/slide-13.png" NAME="graphics13" />

<P>Internet blogs are riddled with stories of people who tried to be
a 10x engineers and ended up a shell of their former selves. DON'T
LET THAT BE YOU THIS SUMMER.</P>
<P>It can be tempting to fall into the trap of &quot;I need to work
all the hours to get a full-time offer.&quot; If you find yourself
thinking this way, ask yourself: If you had to work this much for two
years, would you still be happy? If not, then you probably don't want
that full-time offer anyway, so killing yourself isn't doing much for
you.</P>
<P>There is no magic formula for working sustainably, but as a
general rule, you should be trying to work at a pace where you feel
like you're able to focus throughout the day. If you find yourself
sporting any of the signs in <A HREF="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/adult-health/in-depth/burnout/art-20046642">this
article</A> it may be time to scale back the number of hours you're
working.</P>
<IMG SRC="/images/internship-talk/slide-14.png" NAME="graphics14" />

<P>Every few months a post appears in /r/AskReddit basically asking
&quot;how the hell do I make friends after college?&quot; This
question seems silly if you're used to a university setting filled
with casual interactions, but it highlights the fact that making
friends out of school can be non-trivial, especially if you're
starting from scratch.</P>
<P>If you're interning in a city where you have a bunch of friends
from college then this probably isn't much of a problem. However, if
you're taking an opportunity where you don't know anyone within 50
miles, you're going to have a bit more of a challenge.</P>
<P>Put yourself out there by organizing/attending events with other
interns (most companies will have an interns chat room or mailing
list, go hang out there.  If one doesn't exist, create it). If you're
a solo bandito intern at your companies, find local groups that do
stuff that you're interested in and start regularly attending those
events.</P>
<P>Whatever you do, don't let your summer be characterized by you
sitting around in your apartment by yourself. Not only is this a
bummer of a way to spend a summer, but your mental health will suffer
pretty badly in the process.</P>
<IMG SRC="/images/internship-talk/slide-15.png" NAME="graphics15" />

<P>So yeah, that's pretty much all my thoughts on internship. I'm
sure that I could write another couple hundred words, but most of
your eyes have probably glazed over by now, so that wouldn't do much
good.</P>
<P>If you have any questions about anything I wrote here, or you just
want to tell me that what I wrote was good/misguided/so terrible you
can't believe they let me on the Internet, feel free to contact me at
one of the links in the second slide. Also, I'll be organizing a
couple things with Rutgers Hackathon Club peeps over the summer, so
if you want to get in on that let me know.</P>
