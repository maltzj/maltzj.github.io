title: Is Conference Speaking Worthwhile? 
---

<p>Over the past few months, a few people have asked me about my experience
speaking and blogging, specifically through the lens of what type of
opportunities it has opened up for me.  My thoughts on this have been rattling
around for a while, so I wanted to share them broadly in case other people have
similar questions.</p>

<h2>Some background</h2>

<p>First, a bit of level-setting about exactly how much speaking/blogging I’ve
done over the past couple of years.  Since April 2017 I have:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Given tech talks at eight different professional conferences. These
        talks were generally well received and were well-reviewed.  If you're
        curious about the topics, you can find all of them <a
            href="https://speakerdeck.com/maltzj">on my speakerdeck page</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        I’ve also published ~10 blog posts on technical-ish topics.
    </li>
    <li>
        That content has gotten featured on a couple of Twitter lists and one of my decks was “Featured” on Speakerdeck for a day.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>That works out to around 1 conference talk a quarter and one blog post a
quarter.  That roughly translates to "more content than your average bear, but
certainly not a lot."</p>

<h2>What has all this done for me?</h2>
<p>First, let’s start by talking about the benefits.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Strangers on the internet have said I’m cool</b>: Every once and a while I’ll
        get a tweet from someone saying they read my blog post or saw one of my
        talks and they enjoyed it.  That’s awesome, and it makes me feel really good
        whenever it happens.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>I’ve gotten to go to lots of conferences</b>: This seems obvious, but it’s
        actually really important.  My guess is most companies will fund you to
        go to one conference a year; I go to around four a year without paying for them.
        That means I get 4x the opportunities to immerse myself in content, grow as an
        engineer, and take stuff back to the my team.  That’s been huge for me, and has
        definitely contributed to my breadth of technical skills.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>My company has paid for me to fly lots of places</b>: Work has covered every
        conference I’ve spoken at, even the international ones.  This means that if
        I want to, I can extend my time in a new city for a couple days and pretty
        much only pay for the hotel.  That’s pretty cool, and definitely something I
        appreciate.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>I’ve gotten to meet a lot of cool people</b>: By speaking at conferences I’ve
        gotten to talk with a lot of people I would’ve never otherwise interacted
        with. Most of the time these conversations are 30 minute hallway chats and I
        never see the person again (that’s okay!) but occasionally we’ll tweet
        at each other.  Either way, conference speaking has brought me
        in touch with a lot of lovely, intelligent, and thoughtful people, and I’m
        grateful for all of them.  As a bonus, many of these people were willing
        to talk candidly to me about opportunities when I was job hunting, and
        their referrals fast-tracked me into the interview process.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>I've been forced to formalize my thoughts</b>: Oftentimes my proposals are about
        non-technical topics, so once they get accepted I need to do a bunch of hard
        work to turn them into ideas which are digestible by others.  This process
        of turning “weird amorphous brain soup” it into “coherent narrative” makes me
        better at that topic.  I could probably do that via other means (reflection,
        journaling, etc), but speaking is the one I use.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>I’ve gotten connected to some internet famous people</b>: The “conference
        speaking circuit” (at least with in Android) is surprising small.  Once I’d been to 3 or 4 conferences, 
        I’d crossed paths with a lot of folks who were making cool Android stuff.  
        None of them offered me a job immediately (although some did compliment
        my talks, which was nice of them!), but it definitely make it easier for
        me to ask them for thoughts/feedback on software topics.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>What HASN’T this done for me?</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve talked about what conference speaking has done for me, let’s
talk about what it hasn’t done for me.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>I haven’t made a bunch of friends I talk to regularly</b>: Some people seem
        to have close friendships with their speaking friends, but I don’t talk
        to most of mine regularly.  We mostly get together at conferences have
        dinner, talk about tech, and occasionally share thoughts on Twitter, but
        not much more than that (which is cool!).  I’m super grateful what we DO
        we share, but it's definitely a different kind of relationship.</li>
    <li>
        <b>I haven’t gotten internet famous</b>: I was expecting that after I gave my
        first couple of conference talks, I would have people lining up to hear
        what I had to say;  that’s just not the case.  I currently sit at ~550
        Twitter followers, no one has ever reached out to me to speak on a
        podcast, and I’m certainly not a “thought leader”. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>I haven’t gotten invited to speak anywhere (or even accepted more
        frequently)</b>: This sort of goes along with #2.  I haven’t been invited to
        speak anywhere yet, and my proposals still only get accepted ~25-30% of
        the time.  Maybe one day I’ll get invited to speak somewhere, but it’s
        not something I’m expecting in the near future.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>I haven’t gotten any job offers from speaking</b>: I sometimes see a meme of “Speaking got me my
        next gig” floating around as ‘why you should speak’.  I don’t doubt that this
        has happened to other people, but it has never happened to me.  Speaking
        <em>has</em> given me access to people who could refer me, but I still
        got rejected during the interview process.  Maybe it takes more time for strangers 
        to start giving you job offers from talks, but I don't know what the
        tipping point is.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>So What?</h2>

<p>So, where’s all that leave us?  Good question!  I don’t know! I think my
takeaways after two years of conference speaking are roughly:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Public speaking is cool, and I’ll keep doing it</b>: There’s a lot of upside to
        public speaking: you get to meet nice people and someone else pays for you to
        travel around and learn stuff.  All of that is fun and if you’re into it, go do
        it! 
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Becoming internet famous is hard</b>: I went into speaking expecting to give a
        couple of good conference talks and immediately have opportunities rolling in.
        That hasn’t happened, and I’m not sure how to make it happen.  My guess is if
        you want to reap the rewards of internet fame, you need to tailor your content
        or just produce lots of solid content.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>If you want to get started, work it into your day job if you can</b>: Creating content is hard work; some people claim
        to be able to throw together slides the night before a conference, but it takes
        me at least 15-20 hours to create a polished talk.  I manage this by setting
        aside ~1-3 hours a week to “create content for recruiting” which means writing
        conference proposals, slide decks, or blog posts.  If you can swing that, I’d
        suggest trying it.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>(Slightly more speculative) You get what you put in</b>: I get
        the sense that many people who really trumpet the value of public
        speaking/blogging put a lot of their time and energy into it.  If you really
        want to get those same benefits, my guess is you’ll have to invest similar
        amounts of time.  I’m not sure what the cost/benefit curve looks like,
        but if you find out, please do let me know!
    </li>
</ul>
