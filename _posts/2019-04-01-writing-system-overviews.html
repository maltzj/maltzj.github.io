title: Writing Good System Overviews 
---

<p>Over the years at Nuna, our data platforms have grown from small pipelines
which served simple analytics, to large, polyglot pipelines which can help
patients receive personalized doctor recommendations. As we’ve scaled, our
inline documentation and README’s for specific libraries have been helpful, but
haven’t been sufficient to help new hires understand how our whole system fits
together. In order to help our “Newnas” get up to speed faster, we’ve written a
different type of documentation: a system overview, detailing how the whole
system comes together.</p>

<h2>What’s a System Overview?</h2>

<p>No matter how well you’ve architected your system, at the end of the day,
it’s all just text. For someone to be productive in your system, they need a
mental model of how the system works in order to translate the text they’re
reading into higher level concepts. That’s where system overviews come in.</p>

<p>System overviews are documents designed to create a mental map of how a
system works. When done well, they help provide the context new hires need to
start delivering code quickly and with confidence. When neglected, or written
poorly, system overviews can cause confusion for new members on the team as they
work to understand the cause of an issue.</p>

<p>Building these mental maps may seem hard, but it only requires three key
steps.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Design a block diagram to provide a birds-eye view of the
system</h2>
<p>The first step in designing a mental map of the system is to create a visual
model. Create a block diagram where the major components are blocks and the
relationships between them are expressed as arrows. This diagram helps
developers build a baseline understanding of the system and begins to demystify,
and contextualize, the terms their teammates’ use when talking about their
work.</p>

<p>It can be tempting to over-specify the details of this block diagram, but
it’s best to strive for brevity and clarity rather than completeness. It’s more
helpful to have a concise, rather than cluttered, diagram. You’ll be able to
better express the additional details in the next component of the system
overview.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Write descriptions for each block</h2>
<p>The block diagram introduces a rough mental model of how the system
interacts, but doesn’t provide the supporting detail explaining how each piece
operates. Understanding these details is essential to achieving a greater
awareness of how the system functions.</p>

<p>This documentation doesn’t need to be an exhaustive description, but it
should answer some key questions about each component. These include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What is the purpose of this component?</li>
    <li>What information does it take in?</li>
    <li>How does it operate on the input?</li>
    <li>What information does it produce?</li>
    <li>Are there any special design considerations when making one of these?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to these questions should be brief (2 paragraphs is a sweet spot)
and allow people to look at any class and start to understand roughly what it
does and how it fits into the system. Including these write-ups in your system
overview helps others have a better idea of where their bugs may be hiding, or
where to incorporate a new feature.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Create a concrete example of the system in action</h2>

<p>Close your system overview by creating a worked example to show step-by-step
how the pieces in your system solve a problem. This last step helps to cement
your readers’ understanding of the system, and turn theory into practice.</p>

<p>Good examples contain a few key traits:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>They are real</b>: Resist the temptation to create an example filled with names
        like <pre>FooCleaner</pre> or <pre>BarProcessor</pre>. Names like Foo and Bar are convenient, but they
        don’t help to build a plausible mental model. A contrived, but relatable,
        example is much better.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>They include real, small code examples</b>: Your system overview should contain
        code that demonstrates how to solve your example problem. This code should
        be long enough to help readers understand your descriptions, but shouldn’t
        go into too much detail.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>They touch the whole system</b>: If something appears in your block diagram, it should also appear in your example so your reader can develop a complete mental model.
    </li>

<h2>Keeping system overviews up-to-date</h2>

<p>Once you’ve completed these three steps — designing a block diagram, writing
descriptions of each block, and creating a worked example — your system overview
is in a good place. That’s not to say that our work is done; we still need to
keep your system overview up-to-date as the system changes.</p>

<p>New users to your system are the best monitors of existing documentation, so
have them review it as part of their ramp-up. After they’ve read it, have them
explain what they learned and ask questions. Afterwards, revisit the system
overview, and add any necessary detail to clarify any pieces that may be out of
date.</p>

<p>Our system overviews are constantly evolving, but they’ve proven valuable in
helping to establish a high-level perspective of how our systems work. While
they require some time up-front to write, that investment has more than paid off
in terms of easier onboarding as our systems become more complex. A system
overview is never done, but we’ll keep evolving them as we update our systems
and find new ways to improve patients’ quality of care.</p>
