title: Ship Great Apps Faster By Collaborating With Designers
---

<p>Whenever I hangout with mobile developers at meetups, I hear a bunch of
misconceptions tossed around, but one of the most pernicious is the belief that
designers are head-in-the-clouds artists, throwing pixels around without concern
for what it will mean to implement their creation. On the surface, this
comparison is apt; both artists and designers create visual artifacts out of
ink, paper, and pixels. Dig a little deeper into what designers do every day
though, and you will discover that that <a href="https://medium.com/@raveeshbhalla/lesson-1-design-is-not-art-68c05277bfb2">design is not art</a>. Rather, design is a problem solving discipline which tackles a different, but complementary, set of problems to the ones engineers solve when creating a product. Once engineers internalize this idea of designers as problem solvers and not artists, it opens up a whole new mode of collaboration which allows for otherwise impossible products to be shipped.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most product and engineering teams operate in a way which
makes building this type of understanding difficult. Many teams make problem
definition and ideation solely the realm of designers and product managers with
engineers only getting involved once a mock-up is mostly finalized.</p>
<p>In this world, it’s easy to see why engineers see designers as artists and
not problem solvers. If all an engineer sees is a Sketch file with some
redlines, it’s easy to be blind to all the work that went into figuring out what
to put on the design, and instead focus on the pixel massaging necessary to make
it look good.</p>
<p>This process failure isn’t a problem in the happy path of product
development: designers propose solutions which fit easily within the platform
constraints, and engineers are able to implement them with some light back and
forth. Unfortunately, very few mock-ups can be implemented on this happy path.
Maybe the mock-up proposes adding a bunch of custom one-off dimensions to the
layout, which will make it hard to maintain in the future. Or perhaps there’s an
animation which seems simple, but would actually take weeks to implement (I’m
looking at you, keyboard animations on Android). What’s a team to do in this
case?</p>
<p>The choice I hear all too frequently is to push-and-pull until one side
“wins”. Either the design is implemented as-is, regardless of platform standards
and technical debt incurred, or the feature gets axed as “technically
infeasible”. This type of thinking is a classic example of <a
href="http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/positional-bargaining">positional bargaining</a>, with designers and engineers negotiating against each other about
what the final product should look like. Both of these miss the point though, as
what they should really be asking is “what are we trying to solve in the first
place, and how can we build a solution which gets us there in the best way
possible?”</p>
<p>Once the problem has been reframed that way then folks on both sides of the
table can start to work together to make it a reality. Animations can be
changed, dimensions tweaked, and platform-specific widgets can be used to
replace the custom solution that was initially designed. All of these changes
work together to create a product that solves the same problems for users, but
can be shipped faster and with more maintainable code.</p>
<p>This promised land of faster shipping, happier teams, and satisfied users
sounds great, but getting to this type of collaboration does not happen
overnight. It requires a large amount of education for both designers and
developers so that they can understand the impacts of ignoring the others’
concerns.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Google has started shouldering some of the burden by doing an
all-out Material design education push. This has helped designers understand the
principles behind how to build beautiful Android applications, and it has helped
engineers understand the types of problems their design teams aim to solve
day-in and day-out. At the same time, the Material guidelines are just that:
guidelines; sometimes they will need to be bent, or even broken in order to
solve a particular problem. In those cases, there is no substitute for engineers
and designers understanding some core principles of how the other discipline
works.</p>
<p>So if you’re an engineer, and you encounter a design which seems like it has
some unforeseen technical consequences, take time to talk about those challenges
and the impact they’ll have on your project. And if you’re a designer sharing a
mock-up, don’t throw some redlines on a sketch file and assume your engineers
will understand ideas like grouping, and consistency; take time to educate
engineering teams on the “why’s” of a particular design, including some of the
fundamental principles they may not even be aware of. You may just be surprised
at the end result.</p>
<p><b>Curious of what this looks like in action?</b></p>
<p>When we redesigned the Yelp Android application in 2014, all the mock-ups
called for bottom tabs even though the Android design guidelines specifically
told us not to do it. Our engineers read those design guidelines and expressed
concerns about the mock-ups the design team, citing concerns about platform. Our
design team listened to our concerns, explained why we wanted persistent tabs in
the application, and showed all of the other possible iterations, along with an
explanation about why something like top tabs (which were standard at the time)
were insufficient. At the same time, the initial mock-ups called for those tabs
to stay consistent, but the screen content would still animate. We tried A LOT
of different ways to make this happen, but short of rewriting the whole app to
use Fragments (which would’ve been a mammoth undertaking), or doing some janky
UI tricks on every Activity, we couldn’t figure out how to make this happen. As
a result, we decided to just remove transitions entirely from our app. We were
all bummed that we couldn’t get the type of beautiful transitions that we
initially wanted, but we delivered the most important parts of the design and
didn’t build a mountain of technical debt.</p>
