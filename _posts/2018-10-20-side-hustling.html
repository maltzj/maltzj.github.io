title: Start Side-Hustling 
---

<p>Back in university I worked in a media office, and it seemed like all the
creatives had two jobs in their life: their real job, and the thing they did on
the side.  Our graphic designers would run a consultancy, our photographers
would put together a magazine, and our videographers would were constantly
shooting for events or contests.</p>  

<p>I once asked the head of our office about this, and he sagely responded
“everybody has to have a side hustle”.  Although I didn’t understand it at the
time, years later I’ve come to realize that he’s right: whether you’re a
videographer or a software engineer, having a side-hustle at work can be a
valuable way to grow your skills and impact.</p>

<h2>Side hustling, what’s that?</h2>

<p>A side hustle is pretty much anything you do which is not part of your
specific job responsibilities.  If you’re a software engineer, you could have a
side hustle where you help define and maintain your team’s code review
practices. Alternatively, you could spend time writing blog posts, or leading
brainstorming sessions about team direction.  You can even side-hustle outside
of your day job (we call those hobbies), but for this purpose we’ll just focus
on side hustles during your day job.</p>

<p>Now you may be thinking to yourself “Why bother with side hustles?  Why not
just keep doing and let someone else take care of that messy, non-coding,
work?”  The simple reason is because side hustles represent a huge opportunity
for you and your team.</p>

<p>Side hustle opportunities exist because there’s a problem that needs to be
solved and no ones currently solving it.  Chances are there’s a
problem brewing under the surface, but everyone else has been too busy to deal
with it; this is good news for you! It means there's an opportunity for you to step up,
<a href="https://medium.com/@jean/how-to-lead-by-noticing-and-filling-in-gaps-e3b91506afd2">fill that gap</a>, and learn something new in the process.</p>

<p>Take the above example of a team that doesn’t have clear code review
guidelines.  On a team of three people, it’s probably not such a big deal:
everyone has a social agreement about how code review should operate.  However,
as you onboard a couple of more engineers you notice that code reviews begin to
slow down, and maybe start to focus more on nitpicking than important
questions.</p>

<p>At this point, the problem is probably not the most urgent one for the team,
so no manager or CEO is going to say “time to roll up my sleeves and fix this
team’s code review disagreements”.  However, the lack of code review standards
is a very real problem, and one which left unchecked will lead to slow code
reviews and a lot of grief for the team. If no one does anything and you
onboard four more engineers, your code reviews may descend into slow, grinding,
arguments.  Fortunately, if someone steps up and solves the problem now, before
it’s too late, the whole team will avoid this fate.</p>

<h2>Side Hustles: Good For You Too</h2>

<p>Side hustles don’t just help your team, they help you broaden your own
impact.  There’s always a limited number of technical problems to be solved, so
you may not always be able to lead a shiny new engineering project.  Side
hustles allow you to find a new challenge even when the rest of your job isn’t
pushing you to solve new challenges.</p>

<p>Once you start taking on side hustles you’ll also find that they bring you
into contact with people you would have never otherwise met. These connections
are rarely immediately valuable, but they can be immensely useful as you look
for new opportunities, or even just a new way to solve problems in the
future.</p>

<h2>Okay, so how do I side hustle?</h2>

<p>Great! You’re now on-board with the idea of a side-hustle and you’re keen to
start your own, but you don’t know where to start.  How can you get started
side hustling?</p>

<h3>Define The Problem You Want To Solve and Solve it Locally</h3>

<p>First, you need to figure out what it is you want to solve and how to solve
it.  For me, this always starts with a problem that I’m experiencing for
myself.  Coming back to the example at hand I may say “I’ve been running into a
lot of disagreements on code review lately. How can I fix that”.</p>  

<p>With that problem in hand, I next try to figure out how to solve it locally.
So, I may sit down and say “why do we do code review?” and “how can I make sure
we avoid bikeshedding in code reviews?”.  With those answers in hand, I’d try
to build a set of personal code review guidelines and see how they work.</p>

<h3>Look to see how the problem and solution generalize</h3>

<p>Once you’ve gotten a local solution to the problem, the next step is to
figure out how others view the same problem.  The best way to make this happen
is shockingly easy: talk to people and ask them how they feel about the same
problem.<p>

<p>For me, this often consists of setting up coffee meetings three groups:
peers with context on the problem, peers who are totally unfamiliar with the
problem, and a brief discussion with The Decider(s), people who could block or empower any
solution I come up with.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Generally these meetings consist of me saying <em>“Hey, I’ve been thinking about
    <PROBLEM>, and I’m thinking we should do <SOLUTION> about it.  What do you
    think about that?”.</em> Generally I’m looking for a few things out of these
conversations: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Is the problem a real problem, and is my solution on the right
            track?</b>  If I casually mention this problem to two or three people and no one
        says “yes, we should totally do that”.  Chances are I’m looking at the problem
        the wrong way and need to go back to the drawing board.
    </li>  
    <li>
        <b>Is there additional nuance on the problem?</b> Frequently when I float ideas past people they’ll ask something I hadn’t considered. They’ll say something like  “yes, I totally
        agree that we should have code review guidelines.  How would we have those work
        across teams which have different codebases and release schedules?”  I generally
        file these pieces of feedback away and see how I can incorporate them into the
        project.
    </li>  
    <li>
        <b>Possible allies or co-side-hustlers</b> Ideally, whenever I’m taking on a new side-hustle, I want to have once person working on it with me.  This not only forces me to be accountable to someone, but also it provides a layer of redundancy and emotional support.  Finding
        someone who is excited enough about your solution to join forces isn’t
        necessary, but it is helpful.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Define a project plan and an MVP</h3>

<p>Once you've had your brief conversations and have gotten positive signals about your
direction, the next step is to actually define what you’re going to do to scale
up your idea.  You wouldn’t launch a big feature without first writing up a
design document; similarly, wouldn’t want to implement company-wide code review
guidelines without having a plan for how to draft, review, pilot, and finalize
them.  So write down a plan for your project and make sure it includes a set of
small milestones which allow you to start small, validate your idea, and then
grow from there.  Taking our example of code review guidelines, that plan would
look something like this:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Draft key themes of code review and get them reviewed by senior
        engineers in 3 disparate areas
    </li>
    <li>
        Take feedback create a first draft of code review guidelines, present to
        decider and previous engineers for feedback.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a second draft of guidelines, work through second draft until all
        parties are satisfied.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a final draft of guidelines, present it to other key technical
        stakeholders (maybe all principal engineers + managers-of-managers) and get approval
    </li>
    <li>
        Circulate final draft to see if anyone has any blocking feedback
    </li>
    <li>
        Share new guidelines with the org and put a plan in place to monitor
        their adoption.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Notice how this plan doesn't try to solve the whole problem at once.  It
breaks the problem down into discrete steps and then layers on complexity only
once the foundations are solid.  Whatever your goal is, you want to define a
similar set of clear steps which provide lots of check-in points for others.</p>

<p>Plan in hand, it’s time to get empowered to start
side-hustling.  Generally doing this consists of a meeting with The Deciders, who you
should have already identified and talked to.  If not, here's a quick rule of
thumb: if it’s a team-level change, that’s probably your manager; if it’s larger, it’s probably a
manager-of-managers.  Find your decider and tell them <em>“So I’ve been thinking
    about <PROBLEM> and I think we should do <SOLUTION> about it.  I’m thinking we
    can pilot this by doing <PILOT-PROPOSAL> and then
        <GROW-FROM-THERE-IN-THIS-WAY>.  What do you think about that?”</em></p>

<p>For some people, this may seem weird.  “I’m telling my boss what we should
be doing?  Don’t they know what’s going on?”  Well, maybe, but it’s much more
likely that they have 25 other things which demand there attention, so if you
stroll into their office and say “hi, I’d like to solve one of those problems
for you”, their first thought will not be “get out of my office plebe”, it will
be “oh thank god someone is solving this problem for me.” Remember, the time
between something becoming a problem and the time when it becomes a fire can be
long, and filled with lots of pain.</p>

<p>Of course, they won’t always say “yes” immediately, but they may push you to
revise/clarify a couple of plans.  However, so long as you vet your idea
up-front, chances are you should be able to move forward with your plan.</p>

<h2>They said yes! Now what?</h2>

<p>Great! You’ve gotten the okay for your plan.  Now what?? How can you do your
new project along with your “normal work”? The secret here is running your
side-hustle just like another project.</p>

<h3>Work in Small Chunks</h3>

<p>You wouldn’t run a big engineering project by just trying to
accomplish the whole thing all at once, and you don’t want to do that with your
side hustle either.  You should have defined an MVP, milestones, and a scaling
plan as part of the proposal you showed to The Decider. Now’s the time to use
that. If you haven't, then go make one.</p>

<p>Start by working on the first milestone on your project. In our case, this
would mean just writing down some rough high-level principles and getting
feedback on those.  Execute on that piece 
effectively, document your learnings, and then come back to subsequent
milestones based on what you’ve learned.  Trying to do the whole thing at once
is a recipe for getting overwhelmed, so keep your focus small.</p>

<h3>Find the time</h3>

<p>Once you have that plan, it’s time to start working towards your first
milestone.  Again, you should be treating this like just another engineering
project.  Start by breaking down your first milestone into a set of individual
tasks, and begin working through them. You can even have bi-weekly planning
meetings where you establish a goal for the week and then myopically execute on
that.</p>

<p>I also like to block off 30-60 minute sections at the end of a day as
“side-hustling time”.  During this time I put down my normal work and only work
on side-hustles.  This calendar time is important for me, as it serves as a
reminder to put down the urgent work I’ve been focused on, and refocus on
making forward progress on this important task.  It’s okay if I miss a couple
of these, but I try to make sure to have at least one or two a week so that the
project never slips into “neutral”.</p>

<p>You may also find that as you work through these milestones you’re stuck and
don’t know where to go next.  That’s when it’s a great time to shoot an email
to The Decider and get some feedback from them.  Chances are they can unblock
you by pointing you towards a resource who can help you.  Don’t expect The
Decider to solve your problems, but they are useful if you’re at wit’s end and
don’t know where to turn.</p>

<h3>Get regular feedback</h3>

<p>As you start to accomplish, you want to make sure to check back with the
original person who you worked with to get sign-off.  As you hit each
milestone, report back to them with what you tried, what you learned, and where
you are thinking of going next. They may not be able to jump in and directly
lend a hand (remember, they’ve probably got other priorities), however, they
will be able to serve as a good sounding board for possible landmines on your
way forward.</p>

<p>You’ll often find that this project feels a bit slow and plodding.  That’s
okay!  Your side-projects are never going to move as fast as the things you
spend the other 36 hours a week working on.  What’s important is that you keep
moving forward and showing progress.  If you do that, and you keep trucking
through obstacles, you’ll find that over time your pilot becomes a full-blown
solution.  It won’t be fast, but you’ll find that the people you meet and the
things you learn will make it worth the while.</p>

version of the idea from Jake Knapp's excellent <a
