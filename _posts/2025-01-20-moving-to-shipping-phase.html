title: Changing Process While Moving To Shipping Phase 
---

<p>I oftentimes talk about projects existing in three phases: meetings phase
(defining the scope), building phase (building it) and shipping phase
(converging and flipping the thing on).  Transitioning between these phases is
always a little chunky for different reasons.  Recently I've noticed that I do a
set of consistent things when moving between building phase and shipping phase.
These generally feel right, so I'm probably codifying them.</p>

<p>The three things you should do when moving into shipping phase on a large
project are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Make a dashboard that counts the number of tickets required to
            launch your first user-visible deliverable</b>.  While you're in
        building phase it can be easy to lose sight of exactly how much work is
        remaining in order to get software into the hands of users.  By making a
    dashboard with all outstanding tickets you can give yourself a very clear
    velocity + progress tracker on "how far are we from shipping".  "Number of
    tickets closed per week" is a pretty coarse metric, but it's often good
    enough to set more accurate estimates.</li>
    <li><b>Setup regular bug-bashes.</b>  During building phase it can be easy
        to build a bunch of pieces but not have confidence that they actually
        deliver a coherent experience for users.  To combat this, I'll setup
        weekly bug bashes for the whole team to test features end to end.  This
        helps people get a really visceral feel for "where's the system at
        end-to-end" rather than just "is my feature working".  It also
        encourages you to find rough edges in test setup and rollout which can help smooth
        out your actual launch.</li>
    <li><b>Ensure that each part of the system has an end-to-end owner.</b>  In
        building phase it can be easy to think "horizontally" through the system
        and make sure each component works.  Oftentimes as you enter into
        shipping phase you need to start thinking about the system end-to-end.
        In this world it can be valuable to start to have people owning complete
        slices of features if they don't already.</li>
    <li><b>Write up the actual plan to test and rollout your software.</b>
        Similar to the bug bashe point, it can often be easy to miss "is it
        possible to rollout this thing as a single unit".  You'll want to write
        down a rollout plan to ensure this is possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Doing these things doesn't always ensure that the process of shipping goes
smoothly, but I've found that they generally help.  So next time you're entering
shipping phase, consider keeping a couple in your back pocket to ensure you
launch successfully.</p>
