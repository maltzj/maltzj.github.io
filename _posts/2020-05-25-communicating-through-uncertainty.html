title: Communicating through uncertainty
---

<p>Recently I've found myself in situations where there's no right answer.  In
these situations it can be hard to know how to proceed.  Even when you do make
some decision, it can be hard to communicate that to a team with confidence.
I've recently been watching some great leaders do this, and I've found that
doing it well boils down to a few simple steps.</p>

<p>Good communication through ambiguity does the following.
<ul>
    <li>It makes it clear that a decision has been made</li>
    <li>It makes it clear that trade-offs have been considered</li>
</ul>

<h2>It makes it clear that a decision has been made</h2>

<p>One of the biggest challenges of uncertain situations is making it clear that
the team has committed to <em>some path</em>.  Often there are lots of different
approaches, and some debate about what the correct path is.  Good comms in these
situation make it clear that the debate phase has stopped and the execution
phase has begun.  Rands talks about this effectively in <a
                                                            href="https://randsinrepose.com/archives/mandate-dissect/">his
                                                            article on mandate dissection.</a></p>

<h2>It makes it clear that all angles have been considered</h2>

<p>Ambiguous decisions will naturally leave some people unhappy. For many, their
natural reaction will be "X just doesn't understand this problem" or even worse
"X is actively out to make my life hard", which can lead to lower trust.  Good
communication about these decisions will make it clear that all the angles have
been considered when deciding on this path.</p>

<h2>It says when + how the decision will be evaluated</h2>

<p>Oftentimes working through ambiguity is an exercise in running experiments
and seeing the results.  Good communication about decisions in these situations
recognizes this by describing the decision and saying when + how it will be
evaluated.  This again helps to build trust, and gives an easy path for people
who disagree: if the chosen approach turns out wrong, they'll have more data to
advocate for a different approach.</p>

<h2>It follows-up</h2>

<p>Once the decision has been made and it's been evaluated, it's important to
follow-up with the results and next steps.  This serves two
benefits.  First, it prevents you from <a
                                           href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/dont-scar-on-the-first-cut/">scarring
                                           on the first cut</a> and accidentally
                                       encoding an ineffective decision as permanent
                                       policy.  Secondly, it builds trust 
                                       so that when you suggest
                                       future experiments, people can trust that
                                       you're not acidentally making a trap-door
                                       decision.</p>

<p>Depending on the impact of your decision, it may be useful to follow-up
midway, just to let people know that concerns are being heard and small course
corrections are being taken.</p>

<h2>An Example</h2>

<p>To think about how that works in practice, let's consider a common problem.
Your team has started shipping more bugs to production.  Lots of people have
theories about how to fix this, ranging from hiring a QA team to just shrugging
their shoulders and saying "bugs are a fact of life".  You have decided to try
to resolve this by putting a pre-commit hook which ensures that code coverage is
about 50% for any new pull request.  Let's look at how to message that, starting
first with the simplest message.</p>

<p><em>Hey team, just wanted to give everyone a heads up that starting Monday
    we'll block any pull request which has less than 50% code coverage on any
    change.  Hopefully this will decrease the amount of bugs we ship to
    production.</em></p>

<p>This is a fine approach, and it scores well on making it clear that a
decision has been made.  At the same time, you can imagine the critiques: "code
coverage is a terrible metric", "this will never decrease our bug rate fast
enough".  Let's think about how to resolve that.</p>

<em>
    <p>Hey team, as I'm sure you've noticed, our bug rate has been creeping up
    over the past month, and we've had to roll back a number of our changes in
    production to prevent serious impact to our users.  That's why starting
    Monday we're going to require that all changes have > 50% code coverage
    before merging.</p>

    <p>We recognize that code coverage isn't a perfect metric for making sure
    that our changes are high-quality, but we chose this approach because it's
    something which is fairly quick for us to instrument, and it will allow us
    to quickly understand the impact of more rigorous testing standards on our
    development process. This will make it harder to get
    changes into production, but we have seen that most of our production
    incidents could've easily been caught by testing, so we believe that by
    explicitly encoding a minimum testing bar, it can be a good first step to
    prevent a large class of errors.</p>
</em>

<p>This is way better.  It explicitly shows people that you've considered the
trade-offs, and you've deliberately chosen a set of reasoned trade-offs.  We can
make that even better by clearly framing this as an experiment.</p>

    over the past month, and we've had to roll back a number of our changes in
    production to prevent serious impact to our users.  That's why starting
    Monday we're going to a trial where we require all changes to have > 50% code coverage

    bar can be a good first step to prevent a large class of errors.</p> 

    <p>As with all things, we're treating this as an experiment.  We'll let this
    policy run for 4 weeks, and then check the number of bugs in production and
    talk to some developers to see how it's impacting your workflow.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions, please let me know.</p>
</em>

<p>This final version does everything that the first two do: it clearly
communicates the trade-offs and makes it clear that a decision is being made.
It also frames the change as an experiment, which makes it feel much more
reversible and prevents some amount of re-litigating the issue from people who
disagree.</p>

<p>This approach isn't always perfect.  Sometimes you just need to make a
decision and commit to it for the long term.  However, many times you can frame
your ambiguous decisions as experiments and communicate about them accordingly.
This will lead to happier teams, and hopefully less heart-burn as things
change.</p>
