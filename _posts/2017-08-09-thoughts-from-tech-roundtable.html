title: Discussions on Building Widely Adopted Infrsatructure
---

<p>Every month, a group of engineers at Yelp! get together for something we
call the "technical roundtable", which is basically a big discussion group on
technical topics that are challenging the company.  Often, these focus on specific pieces of
Yelp's technical infrastructure, but our most recent one touched on time
management for mid-level to senior engineers. A lot of the takeaways were
initially surprising but obvious in retrospect, so I figured I'd share them with the
wider internet.</p>

<p>First, one of our engineering managers talked about the concept of <a
    href="https://crew.co/blog/urgent-vs-important/">important vs. urgent</a>
and leveraging your time, which Edmund Lau covers really effectively in his book
<a
    href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Engineer-Engineering-Disproportionate-Meaningful/dp/0996128107">The
    Effective Engineer</a>. Both of these are super useful frameworks, but other
people have written more eloquently than I have about them, so I won't bother
rehashing the concepts.</p>

<p>One thing that they touched on which was interesting is the idea of
giving up responsibilities as a way to foster organizational health.  Over time it's
easy to accumulate a bunch of small, disparate responsibilities like interview
training and learning group scheduling which are important, but= peripheral to
the core job of shipping software. It can sometimes feel like more junior
engineers will only do 80% as well at thse things, but those are some of the
most important tasks to give up to help more junior engineers grow.  Oftentimes,
letting someone do one of these tasks 80% as well in the short term will mean it
gets done 120% as well over the long term, and helps make the whole team strong
because junior engineers can level up. This reminded me a lot of Molly Graham's concept of <a
    href="http://firstround.com/review/give-away-your-legos-and-other-commandments-for-scaling-startups/">Giving
    Away Your Legos</a> and caused me to do a quick activity inventory and start
actively work on giving away some of my own peripheral activities</p>

<p>The second part of the event was a "point/counterpoint" disccussion, where a
variety of engineers got together to discuss the pros/cons of spending our time
in various ways.  I got placed into the "writing code" breakout group, where one
of our infrastructure engineers suggested that it isn't a question of writing
too much/too little code, but rather writing the right code, and reusing
infrastructure where appropriate.  Writing this in hindsight feels kind of
platitudey, much like "using the right tool for the job", but the question of
"how do I create systems that are widely usable" starts to become pretty
challenging in world where 10+ teams are contributing to the same codebase.</p>

<p>We discussed the contours of this problem and came up with a few ways to deal
with it that feel generally applicable:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        If you're trying to build a piece of infrastructure that will be
        generally useful, you have to understand other engineers'
        problems/needs.  Very often it's easy to solve our particular version of
        the problem in a clean, maintainable way, but ignore edge cases that may
        be important to other developers.  Ignoring these is fine if you just
        want a one-off solution, but if you want to make some truly reusable
        systems, it's important to put your PM hat on and understand your users' 
        (i.e other engineers') needs before implementing a solution.
    </li>
    <li>
        This system needs to solve its problem exceptionally well.  If an individual
        developer is confronted with the choice of "go modify someone else's 60%
        solution that I don't really understand to make it fit my use case" vs.
        "Go write a 60% solution which solves my own problems" chances are she
        is just going to write it herself rather than building up enough context
        on someone else's system to improve it.  However, that same system solves
        95% of the her hard problems and the other 5% can be avoided by
        massaging the initial problem, it's much more likely that the same developer 
        will do some up-front work to just use what exists. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Finally, and perhaps most surprisingly, we all agreed that it's
        important to make sure you have a PR push to make other engineers aware
        of what you've built. On a small team, this can be as simple as an email + message
        to your Slack channel saying "hey, did you know about this cool new
        thing we have", but that probably isn't sufficient when you have a team
        of engineers getting innundated with emails. Our most successful
        infrastructure projects have built a critical mass of support by going
        out and showing other people how their solution solves that team's
        problem.  In this way, things like our Data Pipeline have built a 
        critical mass of awareness such that the first thing people think of
        when they're trying to stream data across Yelp!.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of these ideas feel really obvious in retrospect, but it's also really
easy to fall into the trap of producing another 60% solution to that just solves your team's
version of a problem.  It seems like the best solution we've settled on as an
industry is to have infrastructure teams who are incentivized to serve internal
developers combined with feature teams which use those tools and build solutions
to problems which may just work for themselves. I'd love to see if any teams
have built up a system that encourages every engineer to build widely applicable
infrastructure.</p>
