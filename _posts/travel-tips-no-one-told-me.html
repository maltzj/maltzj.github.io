<p>Spend enough time on travel forums searching for travel tips and you'll
inevitably run across heaps of useful advice.</p>

<h3>If traveling outside the developed world, you WILL get sick</h3>

<p>When I was traveling through Laos I came down with a nasty case of food
poisoning in Luang Prabang.  After a couple of hours of vomiting up all the food
or water that crossed my lips, I got my butt to the hospital and spent the night
with an IV in my arm.

After the night, I thought I had finally gotten the edge on other backpackers
and had become a real adventurer, but it turns out that wasn't the case.
Instead of the story being with shock and awe, it was mostly met with a whole
lot of "me too"s accompanied with stories about how others survived third world
food poisoning.

The fact of the matter is that if you travel long enough in a developing area,
food poisoning is not a matter of "will I get sick?", but rather "when will I
get sick, and to what degree".  To minimize the unpleasantness of these
experiences, prepare yourself by bringing along meds to treat stomach illness.
Immodium and Pepto Bismol are a great start, but you'll need antibiotics to
really cover all your bases.  Meds weigh pretty much nothing and take up no
space, so be sure to stock up on plenty beforehand and replenish as you go; your
stomach will thank you.

<h3>Bring a sarong, or if you prefer, a scarf</h3>

Sarongs are the chameleons of travel gear, in that they can become anything you
need at the drop of a hat.  At the beach and need a beach towel? Throw down a
sarong.  In a hostel dorm and need to block out the light so that you can sleep?
Tie it around your head and make your clothes into an eye shade.  Don't have a
coat with a hood? Just toss your scarf over your head.

With all of its uses, a scarf should be in your daypack from minute 1 of your
trip, and it should never leave until you get home.  You'll constantly be amazed
at the new uses you find for it.

<h3>Don't bother bringing white clothes</h3>

Even if you're traveling before Labor Day, wearing white is just a generally bad
call.  White clothes get dirty easily and as a result need to be washed
constantly to avoid looking like a schmuck.  For lazy travelers like me, this
poses the challenging question of whether to spend time/money washing clothes
constantly, or just go with the hobo look.

If you want to avoid this problem altogether, opt darker clothes which won't
show the signs of wear as obviously.  I prefer to go with dark neutrals like
olive and gray, but whatever you choose, just be sure to keep away from white.

<h3>You will meet people at hostels, but you won't necessarily make friends
	there</h3>

Whenever you see posts on travel forums about traveling alone and meeting people, they
are inevitably filled with posts that read something like "oh yeah, just stay in
hostels, you'll totally meet people there".  While this is true, it doesn't tell
the whole story.

If you sit around playing on your cell phone the whole time you're at a hostel
you probably won't meet anyone.  Even if you are open to talking to stranger
(and who doesn't love a good stranger?) that doesn't necessarily mean
everyone you'll meet will become an instant friend.  Instead, you'll spend a lot
of time having conversations which don't go anywhere.

If you talk to enough people, you'll definitely find a few who become
life-changing friends, but that will be the exception rather than the norm.
You'll definitely meet people.
