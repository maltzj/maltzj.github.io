title: Effective Interviewing Through Storytelling
---

<p>This weekend I had the pleasure of getting to attend the <a
    href="http://blooming-coast-2140.herokuapp.com/">AI In Action</a> Spring
2017 hackathon at Claflin University in Orangeburg South Carolina.  AI in Action
focuses on empowering K-12 students in rural South Carolina by teaching them to
code.  While I was there I gave a presentation on an aspect of interviewing that
I think is really under-coached: communication.  These are the slides from that
presentation.</p>
