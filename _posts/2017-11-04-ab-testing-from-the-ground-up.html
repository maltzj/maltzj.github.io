title: A/B Testing From The Ground Up At Droidcon SF
---

<p>I recently had a chance to talk about A/B testing at Droidcon SF as part of a
talk called "A/B Testing From The Ground Up".  The goal with this talk was to
give attendees an overview of all the moving parts needed to get an A/B test up
and running on mobile.  The video should be up in a couple of weeks.  In the meantime, the
slides for the talk are below.</p>
