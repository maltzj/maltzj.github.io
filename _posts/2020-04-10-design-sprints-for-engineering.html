title: Running Design Sprints for Engineering Teams
---

<p>Sometimes engineering teams find themselves in a situation where they're
tackling a cross-functional problem with no clear path forward. In these cases
it can be challenging for individual teams to break out of their silos and see
the global problems, resulting in local optimization while the larger problem
remains unsolved.  Fortunately, teams can follow the structured process of a <a
href="https://gv.com/sprint">design sprint</a> to cut through these problems and
quickly forge a path forward.</p> 

<h2>What's a Design Sprint?</h2>

<p>Design sprints are 5 day exercises which product teams can use to tackle an
ambiguous problem.  Sprints follow a structured process of rapidly gathering
context, ideating on approaches, picking a direction, and putting a prototype in
front of users.  This allows teams to turn weeks of debate into lessons from
users.</p>

<p>Engineering teams generally don't need this whole process, but they can steal
the first two steps: rapid context gathering and ideating on approaches, to
quickly find a path forward for cross-functional problems.  All that's required
is you follow a structured approach to problem solving.</p>

<h2>Day 0: Have a Facilitator Do Some Legwork</h2>

<p>Before you try to run a sprint, you'll need a facilitator.  The facilitator
will act as a guide through the process and ensure that the process moves
towards a workable conclusion.</p>

<p>A good facilitator will have enough context on the problem to guide the
discussion, but they <em>should not</em> be someone who needs to actively
participate in the sprint. Facillitating for 6 hours a day is a full-time job,
and trying to both facillitate and participate is a recipe for
doing neither thing well.  This makes it a good chance for someone to <a
                                                                             href="https://lethain.com/getting-in-the-room/">get
                                                                             into
                                                                            the 
                                                                         room</a>
with decision makers by providing a much-needed skill.</p>

<p>The facilitator has a few jobs leading up to the sprint:</p> 
<ul> 
    <li>They need to a consistent room
            for ~8-10 people for 2 days straight. They'll also need to make sure
            it's <a
                     href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3028471/google-ventures-your-design-team-needs-a-war-room-heres-how-to-set-one-up">appropriately
                     setup.</a>  Finding a conference room that fits this
                 profile isn't easy, so it's one of the first things the
                 facilitator should do.</li>
    <li>They
        need to identify 4-6 people who will be actively participating.  These
        people should be
        experts in their area, have enough knowledge to understand the domains
        of other sprinters, and be in a position to push forward prioritization
        of any requisite work post-sprint.</li> 
    <li>They need to set a schedule of lightning talks and create a consistent slide deck for people to
                 present from. A consistent slide deck may seem like overkill,
                 but it will make sure that the lightning talks on day 1 answer
                 the right questions.</li> 
    <li>They need to 
                 purchase <a href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/supplies">all
                 necessary supplies</a></li> 
    <li>They will need to write a sprint brief explaining the problem the team is solving.</li>
</ul>

<p>The facilitator will also be responsible for sharing and enforcing the No
Distractions Policy.  This means they'll kindly, but firmly, tell people that
they need to leave their phones at the door and not check Slack/email while
they're in the sprint room.  They're welcome to leave at any time to attend to
something, but they just need to do it outside the room.</p>

<p>This is a lot of logistical legwork, but it's important.  This will use ~2
engineering weeks of time, and it's their responsibility to make sure it is well
spent.  Once all of these pieces are in place, it's time to move to day 1.</p>

<h2>Day 1: Lightning Talks To Build Context</h2>

<p>The first day of the sprint is focused on breaking participants out of their
local context and giving them a global view of the problem.  This is accomplished
with a day of lightning talks covering the problem space.</p>

<p>Lightning talks are ~15 minute talks which explain particular team interacts
with the sprint's problem. For example, if the problem is "how
can we reduce number of bugs we ship", you may have a lightning talk from
an application team discussing how they test for bugs, and a release engineering
team talking about how code gets released to production.  The facilitator
should also include talks from relevant non-technical teams like support or
product management to ensure that sprinters have a well-rounded view of the
problem. All told, you'll probably have ~10-12 lightning talks.</p>

<p>During each talk sprint participants should capture opportunities through
<a href="https://www.designkit.org/methods/3">how might we (HMW)</a> statements
on post-it notes. Each of these statements will describe an aspirational
question the team may want to solve based on that lightning talk.  After each
talk, participants will put these up on a shared surface. 
This will serve as the basis for discussion on day 2.</p>

<p>By the end of day 1 you should have a whiteboard filled with problem
statements and a team that is now appropriately level-set.  Day 2 will be about
digesting those and making them actionable.</p>

<h2>Day 2: Digest to problem statements</h2>

<p>Day 1 was all about collecting a variety of problem statements; day 2 is
about synthesizing the global problems.  The team accomplishes this by grouping,
ranking, and driving towards <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7282">rough
consensus</a> on problem statements.</p>

<p>The first step in day 2 is to group the HMW statements from day 1 into
themes.  This doesn't need to follow rigid guidelines, but you'll want to
physically co-locate similar problems together.  Grouping will likely reveal a few
large clusters and a number of smaller satellites.  The facilitator then should give
everyone voting stickers and have them vote on the HMWs they feel are
most impactful, allowing duplicate votes if they feel strongly about a topic.
This whole process will take ~1 hour and it will reveal a heat map of ideas the
team feels are the most valuable.</p>  

<p>The facilitator should take this map and find 3 distinct
areas for participants to dig into.  These problems should be the ones that
got the most votes and cut across engineering teams. This will leave out
impactful problems which are the domain of a single team. That's okay; if a team
already owns a particular problem, their internal processes can likely solve
that problem.</p>

<p>Once the facilitator has identified areas, they should spend ~30 minutes
on each problem getting the participants to distill it down into a problem statement which
everyone can roughly agree on.  For example, if you saw statements like "how
might we allow developers to test on real data?" and "how might we prevent bugs
which only show up on production infrastructure?" you may work with the team to
distill that down to "how might we allow developers to safely test their code in
a prod-like environment?"  This problem statement succinctly captures a global
problem which otherwise may have fallen between teams.</p>

<p>Getting perfect consensus will likely be impossible, but if you can get
something that people can accept for each problem area, that's a big win. Even
if you can't, understanding what's blocking a crisp statement is a big win</p>

<p>Achieving this rough consensus will take the better part of a day, and will
likely leave everyone's brain pretty fried.  You'll want to spend the last bit
of day 2 wrapping up finding any next steps to start making progress on these
problems.</p>

<h2>Day 3 -> Onward: Driving Forward Results</h2>

<p>The two days of sprinting are intense, but they're also only the beginning.
They've produced a set of problem statements, but now they need to get solved.
Solutioneering is it's own can of worms, but there are a few things you can do
to set yourself up for success.</p>

<p>First is the facilitator should broadly circulate notes + takeaways to a
wide group of relevant stakeholders.  This serves two purposes:</p>

<ul> <li>It starts to socialize these problems, so that the wider team can start
        to form a more global problem understanding.</li> <li>It helps make sure
        that you didn't make any big errors. You don't need total agreement on
        the problem statements, but you want to make sure you
        aren't making egregious errors.</li> </ul>

<p>You should also appoint a <a
    href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/">directly
    responsible individual</a> to drive forward solutions.  This person will be
    responsible for making the <a
                                   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JV5cyxS31Q">impossible
                                   decisions</a> involved in turning problem
                               statements into concrete proposals for solving
                               any problems.  They will work with teams to build define <a href="{%
                               post_url 2019-04-21-roadmaps-vs-projects %}">roadmaps and projects</a> as required,
and then ultimately <a href="{% post_url 2019-11-27-getting-decisions-made %}">
    getting those ideas prioritized</a> to deliver solution.

<h2>Where is this not the right idea?</h2>

<p>Running this type of sprint is a great way to get a bunch of shared
context and kickstart problem solving, but it's also time-consuming, so you
don't want to use it in every case. In particular, you probably don't want to use it if:</p>

<ul> <li>You already have a reasonable idea of how to solve a problem, but you
        need to explore its edges.  In that case you may be better served by
        building a prototype or running a hackathon.</li> <li>A number of people
        understand the problem, but it's still not moving forward.  A lack of
        collaboration may not be your biggest problem here, you may have
        underlying organizational issues that need fixing.</li> <li>You aren't
        confident that you can get a DRI responsible for driving solutions. If
        you don't have the ability to execute, all of the brainstorming in the
world won't help you.</li> </ul>

<p>However, if your problem does fit the mold of "we need to get people talking
and brainstorming", running this process can be a great way to cut through the
challenges of cross-team collaboration.  It won't immediately produce a
solution, but it will quickly give you enough to get started, and that be half
the battle.</p>
