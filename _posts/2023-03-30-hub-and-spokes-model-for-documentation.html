title: A Hub and Spokes Model for Documentation on Large Projects 
---

<p>As projects grow it can be difficult to keep track of all of the
documentation associated with them.  Between product requirements documents,
design documents, meeting notes, and <a href="https://adr.github.io/">architecture decision
    records</a> it can be easy to find yourself lost in a forest of Google
Documents trying to find that one document which has the information you need.
A while ago a friend told me about a simple model to manage this complexity on
large projects, something he called "the hub and spokes" model of
project documentation.</p>

<h2>How's it work?</h2>

<p>The basic idea of the hub-and-spokes model is simple: you create a central
document (a hub) which serves as an entrypoint into the project.  Oftentimes
this is some central "why are we doing this thing" document like a product
requirements document or a project brief.  You then use that to link out to
smaller documents (notes, decision logs, scoping documents) which describe a more focused
topic.  Within the more focused document you include a backlink to the "hub" so
that folks can walk up the stack.</p>

<p>This approach isn't necceary in tools like Confluence which
automatically create a documentation tree, but they take a little more
discipline when you're just using a raw documents tool like Google Docs.</p>
