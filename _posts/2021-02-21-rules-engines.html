title: Some Thoughts on Rules Engines 
---


<p>Spend enough time working with domain experts on a problem and someone is bound
to say "we should build a rules engine to solve this problem."  Often this comes
along with the goal of letting domain experts express rules themselves rather
than having to evolve engineers.  However, once you start to dig into this
problem you'll discover that "rules engine" can mean many different things to
many different people.</p>

<p>I've seen this problem a few times over the past couple of years, and I've
come to think it's useful to break down your rules engine across a few important axes.
Doing this will allow you to have clear discussions on what problems you need to
solve and what you need to build to solve them.</p>

<h2>The questions</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>What data do your rules have access to?</b> Do your rules need to
        arbitrarily grab data from a database, or are there a set of well-defined
        features that people need to express their rules?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>When will your rules run?</b> Do they run on every request? When some
        set of known events happen within your system? Whenever a data pipeline
        kicks off?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>What actions will your rules take when they pass?</b> Do they just
        need to output true/false, or do they need to output some more complex
        actions?  If the latter, what do you do when a set of rules conflict?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>How complex are the rules you want to express?</b> Do you essentially
        want to run arbitrary logic to match rules, or do you have a set of
        simple if/else conditions that you need to follow?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>How do you want to express your rules?</b> Is abstractions in a
        programming language okay?  Or do you need something simpler?
    </li>
</ul>

<p>All of these taken together form a set of constraints for your rules engine.
If you want to express arbitrary logic over arbitrary data, well then you're
probably doing to need to write a <a
                                      href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BusinessReadableDSL.html">business
                                      readable DSL</a> or use something like <a
href="https://www.drools.org/">drools</a>. If you can simplify across some
dimension, you can probably save yourself some work .</p>

<h2>Looking at this in practice</h2>

<p>Let's think about how all this works in practice by using a few examples.</p>

<h3>Radar from Stripe</h3>

<p>Stripe's Radar product <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/radar/rules">has a rules
engine</a> which allows merchants to configure how they should handle charges. It
answers the above questions in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>What data do your rules have access to?</b> A constrained set of
    features that Stripe provides.</li>
    <li><b>When will your rules run?</b> On every charge to your business.</li>
    <li><b>What actions will your rules take when they pass?</b> Block, allow,
    review, or request 3DS for the charge. Conflicts are resolved by choosing
    the first rule that decided on an action.</li>
    <li><b>How complex are the rules you want to express?</b> Fairly simple, a
    few if/else conditions.</li>
    <li><b>How do you want to express your rules?</b> A simplified DSL that any
    non-engineer can configure.</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach constrains users across almost every dimension, but the
resulting rules engine is simple enough that almost anyone can use it.</p>

<h3>FXL From Facebook</h3>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum is <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/10158791577587200/">FXL</a>, a language
that Facebook developed for fighting spam.  It has slightly different answers to
these questions.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>What data do your rules have access to?</b> "A Multitude". We don't
        know for sure, but probably more than the O(10s) of features radar
        allows.</li>
    <li><b>When will your rules run?</b> Presumably something like "whenever a
    content creation request comes in."</li>
    <li><b>What actions will your rules take if they pass?</b> They may log
    requests, block posts, or warn users. Other actions and conflict resolution
    is undefined.</li>
    <li><b>How complex are the rules you want to express?</b> Seems like they
    can get quite complicated.</li>
    <li><b>How do the rules get expressed?</b> A hand-rolled language called
    FXL.</li>
</ul>

<p>FXL's rules engine gives users more power at the expense of some complexity.
The rules are actual code rather than fancy configuration. This creates spam
fighting superpowers at the price of it being harder for non-engineers to
interact with write.</p>

<h3>SQL-Based Rules Engines</h3>

<p>Another common pattern is the SQL-based rules engine, which <a
href="https://medium.com/@siddhesh.jog/an-sql-based-rule-engine-6a187e2d88d8">has an example
here</a>.  The general idea of these is often "our domain-experts already
understand SQL, so let's allow them to just write their rules in a language they
know."  Again, this can fit into our framework.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>What data do your rules have access to?</b> Anything in your
    database.</li>
    <li><b>When will your rules run?</b> Probably in response to a web request.
    <li><b>What actions will your rules take if they pass?</b> Some set of
    actions defined as stored procedures.  Resolution is again unclear.</li>
    <li><b>How complex are the rules you want to express?</b> Not crazy simple,
    but also not crazy complicated as well.  We could probably express some
    pretty complex stuff in raw SQL if we needed to though.</li>
    <li><b>Hwo do the rules get expressed?</b> SQL statements that follow a
    well-defined form.</li>
</ul>

<p>These approaches fit somewhere in between the two approaches above.  They
seem useful when you want to return a simple classification result,
but it may get more challenging if you want to take more complex actions.</p>

<h2>Using the framework</h2>

<p>I'm not totally sure <em>exactly</em> how to use this framework yet, but it
has been useful for me to ask these questions whenever someone says "we need a
rules engine."  I hypothesize that if you want to keep the expression language
simple, you'll need to invest more engineering-time to provide curated data to
your rules engine and limit what it can do.</p>  

<p>I also imagine that these approaches can be mixed-and-matched for maximum
effectiveness. For example, you could have a rules engine which is based on a
business readable DSL, and provide some tooling for non-engineers to create for
common use-cases.  This allows for iteration speed in the common case without
sacrificing power when you really need something complex.</p>
