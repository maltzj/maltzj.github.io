title: Managing Documents In a Hybrid World 
---

<p>When teams shifted to remote + hybrid work, they also needed to adopt a much
greater emphasis on having a written culture.  On our team, this came with an
additional problem: we ended up with so many documents it was hard for us to
understand which ones were important/unimportant.  Shortly after that, we had a
new manager joining our team and he gave us a few tools to manage this document
explosion.</p>

<h2>Tool #1: Clarify The purpose of the Document Via Emojis</h2>
<p>The first challenge tackled was that documents take on many purposes.  Without any
clear signal for “this is what this document is intended to do” it was hard for
readers to differentiate “here’s a half-baked idea that I’d love 30% feedback
on” from “this is a design document that we’re now implementing”.  To fix that,
we created a simple emoji-based taxonomy for all of our documents. The system worked as follows.</p>

<ul>
    <li>A 💻 represented a design documents, and were assumed to express “here
        is a thing I am planning to build”.</li>
    <li>A 👀 represented a “validate my perspective” document.  These could be
        anything from “Here’s a wild idea I had for a team process change” to “a
        rough cut of what our next quarters OKRs should be before we go into
        planning”.</li>
    <li>A 🌅 represented a vision document.  These could either be technical
        vision or product vision.  Either way, they were not assumed to
        represent exactly what we were build, but directionally were we were
        going.</li>
    <li>A Gavel emoji represented a decision document and expressed “here is
        some decision which needs to be made outside the scope of a design
        document”.  It could be a technical decision (“how will we scale the foo
        service”) or a team process decision (“how frequently will we hold
        sprint planning”)</li>
    <li>A 🗒️ emoji represented meeting notes</li>
</ul>

<p>Taken together, this simple taxonomy helped readers who stumbled across some
random document clarify “how should I reason about this”.</p>

<h2>Tool #2: Store All Documents of a Particular Type In a Folder</h2>

<p>Once we had a taxonomy, we then created a simple system for organizing
documents according to their type.  We started out by organizing according to
type (all 👀 would go into one folder, 🌅 into another, etc.) but we found this
to be a little overwhelming as time went on.  Instead we moved to a simple
format where largeish projects would have their own folder where all documents
lived (often with <a
                          href="http://maltzj.com/posts/hub-and-spokes-model-for-documentation">a single
                          “hub” document</a> as an anchor) while other documents
                      (small design documents, unrelated "validate my
                      perspective documents", etc.) would go into the shared
folder.</p>

<p>This proved to be very helpful because we found document search in most tools
works ~75% of the time.  We often found ourselves knowing “oh yeah, I had a
gavel document for that somewhere” or “I think someone wrote a vision document
for that” but not knowing the exact search incantation to find it.  By having a
simple folder structure to store documents we were able to save a lot of time
hunting for documents.  This also played nicely with icons, as we could easily
look at any document without a folder, look at its icon, and know where it
needed to be moved to.</p>

<h2>Tool #3: Clarify Status at the Top of Each Document</h2>

<p>After those two changes, we adopted was having a simple “status” box at the top of each
document.  This status box was a  one cell table which contained the
author, the date the document was updated, and a status of the document (whether
it was early draft, ready for review, or just some rough scribbles on a page).
In practice it looked like this.</p>

<table border="1px">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <b>Author:</b> Maltz<br />
            <b>Status:</b> Very early draft.  Believed to be directionally
            correct, but not ready for feedback yet.<br />
            <b>Last Updated:</b> Apr 25, 2023 <br />
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br />


<p>By clarifying when a document was ready for feedback and when it was last
updated, readers could understand what level of feedback was appropriate for the
current document status.  This helped us in a couple of concrete ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>It prevented some classes of thrash where someone would write a spicy
        “validate my perspective” document, share it with a couple of people,
        and then forget about the document.  Someone would then find the
        document 6 months later and get heartburn that some big change was
        happening.</li>
    <li>It prevented people from finding a design document that was 30% complete
        and giving it fine-toothed-comb feedback even when it wasn’t ready for
        that.</li>
</ul>

<p>In both of these cases, the presence of a simple “status” box helped readers
contextualize “how much should I care about this” and “how should I engage with
this document”.</p>

<p>In practice we didn’t enforce a strict policy on keeping these fields up to
date, but documents which tended towards adoption would get the fields updated
naturally just through sheer number of eyeballs.</p>

<h2>Tool #4: Clarify expected approvers when necessary</h2>

<p>Once we had this taxonomy, we encountered one other problem: for documents
which were trying to drive towards a “decision” (i.e. Gavel documents or design
documents) it would be unclear who was responsible for actually saying “this
decision has been made”.  We solved that by adding a small section at the top
called the “Gavel Block”.  This was a simple list of people who needed to
approve and could check-off their names or add blocking feedback.</p>

<p>This practice was again simple but very helpful for clarifying the <a
                                                                              href="https://project-management.com/understanding-responsibility-assignment-matrix-raci-matrix/">RACI
                                                                              Matrix</a> around a particular document.  If your name wasn’t on the gavel block,
you didn’t have to review.  Similarly, if you came through with feedback and
wasn’t on the gavel block, then the author could easily clarify “do you want to
be on the gavel block” or “is this non-blocking feedback”.</p>


<p>These tools didn’t solve all of our challenges related to having a heavily
written culture, but they did help our team operate substantially more
effectively.  Plus, they were lightweight and easy to adopt.  If your team is
struggling to sift through a pile of documents they’re probably worth a try for
you as well.</p>
