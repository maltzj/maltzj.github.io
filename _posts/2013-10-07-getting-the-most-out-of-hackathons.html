title: Getting The Most out of your First Hackathon
---

<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that over the past three years hackathons have exploded
across the country, bringing with them the opportunity for thousands of students
to grow their coding skills and build a community of developers at their
university.  Despite this massive growth, it seems that hackathon knowledge is
still spread by word of mouth, leaving some younger students wondering how to
get started.</p>

<p>Every couple of months a new student will pop into our Rutgers Hackathon Club
Facebook group and ask &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a freshman, can I still join and be
successful?&rdquo; (<em>yes, you can</em>), &ldquo;I only know [INTRO TO CS
LANGUAGE], can I still make something?&rdquo; (<em>yes, you can</em>) or
&ldquo;how do I know what project to work on while I&rsquo;m there?&rdquo;
(<em>more on that later</em>).  Although much of this is tribal knowledge
among veterans, no one has taken the time to codify how newcomers get the most
out of their experience.  To that end, I&rsquo;ve put together a dead simple
list of everything a first time attendee needs to do so as to maximize their
initial hackathon.</p>

<h4>Read up a little bit (optional)</h4>

<p>For a coding newbie, your first event can definitely be an intimidating
experience.  People will be throwing around terms like RESTful API, JSON, NoSQL,
and client library like they&rsquo;re the most natural thing in the world.
Meanwhile, you&rsquo;re sitting at API demos hoping wondering how the hell to
get a webpage displayed on localhost (or even wondering what the hell this magic
localhost is).</p>

<p>If you want to spend your time developing software instead of learning
concepts, a little reading goes a long way. Being able to cite the HTTP spec
backwards (or even knowing what it is) certainly isn&rsquo;t necessary, but if
you want to build a webapp, knowing about HTTP requests and responses will save
you a lot of conceptual headache.  Similarly, if you want to build a mobile app,
hello worlding an app in your simulator before the hackathon will save you a lot
of headache on the day of the event.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure where to start learning some of the subjects
discussed above, there are a <a

<a
	href="http://gigaom.com/2010/10/29/using-apis-not-quite-as-hard-as-it-looks/">tutorials</a>
<a href="http://www.looah.com/source/view/2284">out</a> about utilizing APIs
for the web, with the first link there in particular being highly recommended.
It&rsquo;s written in Python, but reading the code should be pretty
straightforward for anyone with programming knowledge.  If you are looking to do
something more mobile-based, the docs for starting <a
	href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/bundle.html">Android
	development</a> and <a
	href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/chapters/Introduction.html">iPhone
	development</a> are also ridiculously extensive.</p>

<p>Even if you decide not to do any reading beforehand, there will assuredly be
tech talks and mentorship to get you up to speed with the basic terminology, so
don&rsquo;t let a lack of background knowledge stop you from attending.</p>

<h4>Known what you want to accomplish</h4>

<p>This can be as simple or as vague as you&rsquo;d like, but it&rsquo;s always
good to have some type of plan about what you want to accomplish during your
24-48 hours.  Your goal can be something as simple as finish and demo SOMETHING,
or it can be as detailed as &ldquo;build a game on Android where squirrels fly
through the air and eat exploding acorns&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re coming to a hackathon with the goal of learning but
don&rsquo;t know what you want to learn, just pick a random language (Python and
PHP are easiest for webapps) and plan to make an application that uses that
language.  Alternatively, if you&rsquo;re stuck on an application idea, watch
the API demos and see if any of the APIs helps solve a problem that you&rsquo;ve
encountered.  If you&rsquo;re still stumped on a project, head to the
event&rsquo;s pitch session and join a team that seems like it has an awesome
idea, there will be tons of teams there that would love to have your help.</p>

<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject of teams, I want to address one of the most
common questions I see in the Rutgers Hackathon Club: &ldquo;Do I need to go
with a team already in place?&rdquo;.  The answer to that is no, not at all.  In
fact, you don&rsquo;t even need to want to work with a team; it is perfectly
acceptable for you to go solo-bandito and work by yourself.  If coding solo
that&rsquo;s not your cup of tea, there are also plenty of ways to join or
create a team on site.  For your first time, the easiest way to deal with teams
is either head in with an idea of some people you&rsquo;d like to work with (it
doesn&rsquo;t have a codified team, just 4-5 people you could envision yourself
working with), plan to work solo or plan to jump on board with someone
else&rsquo;s team. There is also the option of trying to build and lead a team
of strangers on-site, however, unless you have experience with this, I&rsquo;d
advise against trying to lead a team of strangers that you met at the event,
simply because working with new people always adds a bunch of layers of
complexity.</p>

<p>Whatever your team and your goal, make sure to push your skills as a
developer.  Hackathons are a unique opportunity to have tons of mentorship at
your fingertips; take advantage of that by trying something hard and getting
extra help as necessary.</p>

<h4>Talk to people</h4>

<p>You&rsquo;re probably coming to this event to code, but that doesn&rsquo;t
mean that you need to spend all of your time creating features and debugging
errors; you should also spend some time getting to know the other students
attending the event.  Hackathons are frequented immense community of students
and mentors who travel to events multiple times a month, exchange ideas, and
generally share their passion for making awesome technology.  By taking time out
of your hackathon to meet other attendees, you will not only make some great
friends, but also you will find opportunities to learn more about programming,
get resources for your hack, and even find internships/jobs that you otherwise
wouldn&rsquo;t have known about,</p>

<p>Granted, if this is your first time at a hackathon, the prospect of making
new friends in a sea of 1,000 people could seem like a daunting task.  If
you&rsquo;re a bit overwhelmed with how to get started meeting other hackathon
attendees, try one of these two ideas to get you started.</p>

<ol> <li><p>Go with your school/friends.  Chances are your school has a group of
	students who are interested in programming outside of the classroom, seek
	them out at your school CS lab, see what events they&rsquo;re going to, and
	then join them for those events.  If you&rsquo;re not sure what to look for,
	just listen for passionate debates about technology.  If the students
	involved do already regularly attend Hackathons, they will certainly be
	interested in traveling to one with you.  Regardless of how you find fellow
	hackers, don&rsquo;t be shy about being new, I can guarantee you that your
	fellow developers would love to share their passion for technology with you.
	If you&rsquo;re on the Eastern seaboard and don&rsquo;t have a group of
	hackers at your school, drop me a line at <a
		href="http://twitter.com/maltzj">@maltzj</a>, I&rsquo;ll see if I can
	get you integrated with our network of Rutgers students.</p></li>
	<li><p>Once you&rsquo;re at the event, wait for a little while and find
	someone who looks like they&rsquo;re taking a break, walk over to them and
	ask them what they&rsquo;re working on.  99 times out of 100 he or she will
	start excitedly talking to your about his or her team&rsquo;s project.  Ask
	some questions about themselves, their school, and technology that
	they&rsquo;re using. Then, get their name, and wish them good luck.  If you
	see that person again, check up on how their project is doing or
	congratulate them on an awesome presentation if it&rsquo;s after
	demos.</p></li> </ol>


<p>After the event, if you feel like the you got along with someone, exchange
contact information (business cards and twitter are great for this), stay in
touch with your new friend via the interwebs, and catch up at events throughout
the year.  Congratulations, you just made a friend and &ldquo;networked&rdquo;,
that wasn&rsquo;t such an icky and soulless process was it?</p>

<h4>Always, always demo.</h4>

<p>At the end of every event there will be a period where everyone who attended
can show off what they built to the other attendees.  No matter how far along
your project is, demo SOMETHING.  Seriously, even if it is a concept and half a
webpage, you should demo it.  For the last 24-48 hours you&rsquo;ve worked hard
to build something that you would have thought impossible at the beginning of
the event.  You deserve to have your hard work rewarded, if not with a prize,
then at least with a round of applause from your peers.  In case you&rsquo;re
thinking that you shouldn&rsquo;t demo, let me share a story which changed the
way I looked at demoing forever.</p>

<p>My first hackathon was the <a href="http://2012s.pennapps.com/">Spring
	Penapps in 2012</a>.  After starting off with a ton of energy, the event
turned into a disaster which culminated in my team and I making a project called
&ldquo;Easy Mood&rdquo;, a website sort of like rainy mood but way uglier and
with kittens (side note: when in doubt, use kittens and gifs). When demo time
approached, I was feeling pretty ashamed our project and didn&rsquo;t want to
submit it for presentation.  At around the same time, Rutgers Hackathon club
founder and Major League Hacking Commissioner, <a
	href="https://twitter.com/swiftalphaone">Swift</a>, was walking around
talking to the Rutgers contingent about what they did.</p>

<p>He came over, asked our team what we did, and I sheepishly explained our
project while confiding that I didn&rsquo;t really want to present.  As soon as
the words left my mouth he said, in classic Swift fashion (with slightly choicer
language) &ldquo;Jonathan, I don&rsquo;t care what you say, you&rsquo;re
presenting&rdquo;.  This was immediately followed by a Swifttastic tirade in
which he simultaneously browbeat me into presenting while giving me enough
confidence to do so.  It was really quite impressive.   After that pep talk we
decided that there was really no downside to presenting our project, so we went
up their and sold Easy Mood as best we could.  It just so happened that we were
the only team to use a <a href="http://www.mashery.com/">Mashery API</a>, so
one of my teammates ended up walking home with a Jambox, a $200 piece of
hardware.  Not bad for a group that was going to hide in the audience not more
than 30 minutes prior.</p>

<p>If that isn&rsquo;t enough for you, think about this: at some point in your
life you&rsquo;re going to have to sell the idea that something is awesome.
Maybe that something will be a product that your company produces, or maybe it
will be yourself when an interviewer asks &ldquo;Sally, tell me about this here
project on your resume&rdquo;.  Regardless of what you&rsquo;re selling, in
moments like those you need to know how to take something and make someone else
understand why it is awesome.  Hackathon demos are the best time to hone that
skill because no matter what happens, you have a supportive audience who will
cheer you on even if your demo is a catastrophic failure.</p>

<h4>Wrapping Up</h4>

<p>So that&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s all you need to do in order to get the most
out of your Hackathon experience.  You don&rsquo;t need god-like web programming
skills and you don&rsquo;t need to be able to know 10 different programming
languages.  Instead, all you need to do is show up to the event with a positive
attitude and follow the four simple actions I outlined above.  If you do that,
you&rsquo;ll walk out of your first hackathon with a whole raft of new skills
and some new friends to boot.</p>
