title: When Should You Spend Time on Technical Vision 
---

<p>One of the challeging things about being a technical leader is knowing how
much time to spend on big-picture vision setting vs. writing code and solving
the problems of today.  Spend too much time on vision setting and you may start
designing solutions which are disconnected from reality.  However, if you don't
spend enough time on vision your team will sputter over the long-term.  Over the
last couple of years I've found a few heuristics to apply which let you know
when it's time to jump into "vision setting mode".</p>

<h2>What's Technical Vision</h2>

<p>Before digging into <em>when</em> you need to spend more time setting a
technical vision, it's important to understand <em>what</em> a technical vision
looks like.  A technical vision can take many forms, but it's most often an
aspirational document (frequently ~2 -> 5 pages) which outlines an ideal future
technical state that a team will achieve over the next 18+ months.  Technical
visions are useful as an anchor point in the <a

of strategy</a> to help tie-break day-to-day technical decisions.  They rarely
end up being exactly correct, but they can also serve as a useful tool to
                                                     elucidate any large gaps in
                                                     what your team is currently
                                                     building and help the team
                                                     take a first step towards
                                                     fixing those gaps.</p>

<h2>What are The Signs You Need To Spend Time Clarifying Your Technnical
Vision</h2>

<p>All of those things seem great, so why not just spend all of your time on
technical vision?  Unfortunately, creating one comes with a cost. The first cost
is obvious: drafting and building consensus around a vision takes substantial
amount of time from the author and reviewers to make sure the vision is
directionally correct.  Vision documents <em>also</em> come with a cost for the
team.  Once drafted, you actually need to get the team to shift course and use
that vision in their day to day decision making.  While this is useful, it also
takes time, and can lead to a feeling of whiplash if the team feels like they're
changing their north star too frequently.  So, what are some cues you can use to
know that it's time to pay this cost and draft a technical vision?</p>

<h3>Case #1: When people are constantly disagreeing over small changes</h3>

<p>One of the first signs that the team needs a clearer technical vision is if
the team is constantly getting bogged down in small design decisions.  While
some design push-and-pull is to be expected on code reviews and design
documents, the team should spend most of their day-to-day time discussing
questions on the margins rather than constantly re-litigating core questions
about what you're building. </p>

<p>If you start to see the team having these "re-litigate the world" discussion
frequently, chances are there's a few key underlying architectural decisions
which the team has not investigated and decided upon.  Drafting a technical
vision can help bring these disagreements to the forefront and allow the team
to come to a consensus about how to architect a solution to these problems.
While the vision won't magically solve all design disagreements, having an
agreed-upon north star should prevent the team from churning on the same design
issues every code review.</p>

<h3>Case #2: When team discussions become sprawling</h3>

<p>Sometimes teams will encounter a situation where they can make design
decisions effectively, but it feels like many decisions are time-consuming
because they require "inventing the architecture as they go".  In these
situations, the problem isn't so much disagreement so much as confusion about
how all of the pieces of the system should fit together.  This means that simple questions
like "how should we deploy this thing" becoming sprawling discussions without
about "well how do we even <em>want to use</em> Jenkins here".  While some
amount of this type of "zoom out" thinking is useful, if you find it's slowing
down the team it may be time to invest in clarifying your technical vision.</p>

<p>Resolving vision gaps in these cases is often slightly different than in Case
#1, as there may not be any core disagreements to resolve.  Instead, it may just
be a case of a team having differing expertise, and no one has yet stitched all
of the moving pieces into a coherent narrative.  As a result, in these cases may
have less disagreement-resolution, and more stitching-together disparate pieces
of context into a coherent whole.</p>

<h3>Case #3: When you've hit a local maximum</h3>

<p>Sometimes it becomes clear that your current way of doing things just won't
work.  Maybe you're constantly firefighting bugs in your infrastructure, or
maybe your customer requests are becoming progressively harder to implement.
Regardless of the symptoms, if your team is churning through problems as best it
can, but it seems like you're stil falling behind, chances are you need to do a
clarify your technical vision and chart a path to something fundamentally better.</p>

<p>These types of technical vision can feel a little different than ones created
for the other two cases.  They will still chart a course to a glorious future,
but they also need to come with a concrete first step ("we will start
on this vision by doing X to solve our immediate scalability needs") which helps
the team out of its current situation.</p>


<p>These three cases aren't the only times teams will need to
clarify their technical vision, they do represent three common cases to look out
for.  So, if you find yourself repeatedly bogged down in the same technical
discussions, struggling to fit together a number of disparate design decisions
into a coherent story, or just stuck in a technical rut, it's worth asking
yourself "does our team have a clear enough vision about how to solve this
problem" and filling that gap if not.</p>
