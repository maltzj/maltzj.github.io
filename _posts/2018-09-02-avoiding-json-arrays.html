title: Do You Really Need That JSON Array?
---
<p>When building APIs, it’s common to run into a problem
which is basically a form of “We want an API that will support a list of
something.”.  In situations like this, it can be tempting to just send back a
JSON Array and call it a day.  However, I've found that this is rarely the
right decision, and by making a slight tweak to this design you can make your
APIs much more extensible.</p>

<p>To understand why structuring your response as a top-level JSON Array may be
a problem, consider the following: let’s say we’re trying to show a list of
restaurants in an application.  If we’ve naively serving up an array of
restaurants from our API, that means our responses will look something like the
following:</p>

<pre>
[
    {
         “restaurant_id”: 1234,
         “restaurant_name”: "My restaurant",
         “restaurant_cuisine”: "Indian",
         ... 
    }
    ... 
]
</pre>

<p>On the surface, this is totally fine: you can parse this JSON with any
library and handle it easily.  However, what happens if you want to do something
like add a list of suggested search filters that the user could drill down by?
With this API design you don’t have many options: you basically have to ship a
breaking API change in order to support the new feature or create another
endpoint.</p>

<p>The shame of the situation is that it’s easily avoided.  If instead of
sending back a top-level JSON Array, we made our top-level element a JSON Object
with a single key, we would’ve ended up with a response which looked something
like the following:</p>

<pre>
{
   “restaurants”: [
   {
       “restaurant_id”: 1234,
       “restaurant_name”: "My restaurant",
       “restaurant_cuisine”: "Indian",
       ... 
   }
   ... 
   ]
}
</pre>

<p>Now if we want to add search filters we can just add another key to the
top-level JSON object, giving us something like:</p>

<pre>
{
   “restaurants”: [
       ... 
   ],
   “suggested_search_filters”: [
       ... 
   ]
}
</pre>

<p>Boom! Instant backwards compatibility with no hassle.</p>

<p>There are probably cases where adding the additional layer of nesting is not
the right decision, but I’ve found that the flexibility provided by the approach
outweighs the costs in all situations I’ve encountered.  So the next time you’re
thinking about building an API to surface a list of content and you’re tempted
to reach for a JSON Array, ask yourself “should I make this an object instead”,
it might just save you some headache down the road.</p>
