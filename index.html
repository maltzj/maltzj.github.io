	<h2>Hey there!</h2>
	
	Hiya! I'm Jonathan Maltz, and it looks like you've stumbled on my
	personal website.  If you're curious
	about software, community, helping students get the most out of university,
	or the intersection of any of those that's awesome, because I am as well.
	In fact, I've even written a bit about those topics, and you can find those
	posts below.  You can also find out more about me or see a more consice list
	of what I've written by following the links on the left.
