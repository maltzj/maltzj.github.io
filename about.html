  <p>Hi there, thanks for stopping my by little corner of the internet.  In case
  you stumbled here by accident, I'm Jonathan Maltz, a soon-to-be Rutgers
  graduate and a software devloper, an avid traveller, occasional reader, and a
  mediocre cook when I have the time.  I have this crazy idea that in our modern
  world a lot of problems are caused by people lacking a sense of community, so I'm really
  passionate about building community wherever I can.  In the virtual world I do
  that as one of the admins of the <a
	  href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ruhacking/">Rutgers Hackathon
	  Club</a>, and in the physical world I couchsurf and will hopefully start
  organizing/taking part in some other fun stuff once I'm in SF.</p>
  
  <p>After graduation, I'll be heading over to Yelp! Inc to help make their Android
  app even more awesome then it already is and hopefully create some great open
  source tools in the process.  Until then, I've been keeping busy
  by helping maintain a couple of awesome open source Android Apps: <a
	  href="https://github.com/manmal/hn-android">HN-Android</a>
  and the <a href="https://github.com/github/android">Github Android App.</a>  I
  also maintain a serious developer crush on Hans Dockter and the team at
  Gradleware, and I hope that one day I can make something half as awesome as
  Gradle.</p>

  <p>I started this website because over the past couple of years, I've found
  myself constantly finding situations where I'm like "damn, I really wish
  someone had told me this two years ago".  So, I started writing about those
  things and posting them on the internet in hopes that future folks will read
  them and be saved the heartache that those problems caused.  I'm unsure if I've
  accomplished that goal yet, but I'll keep writing in any case.</p>
